        "text": "What I find very strange about this case are the photos. At one point, they are smiling and enjoying their trip together at every photo they take, even when only one of them is being photographed by the other. But then suddenly Kris is being photographed from a far distance. \n\nShe has a different facial expression. What suddenly changed that she's not smiling anymore? \n\nShe carried a bottle of a water with her. Why did she carry the bottle if they had a backpack? Why would she wanna carry a bottle of water with her while walking through such a hard terrain? \n\nWhy would Lisanne photograph Kris when she was turned back? I would understand that if the photos were taken on an i-Phone. When you photograph on an i-Phone you usually don't care what you document because later the photos can be easily organized and deleted. But when you have a camera, it's a different experience. First of all, the process of taking photos isn't that fast as it is on a phone (especially in 2014 with an older technology) so you think about what you photograph. Second of all, it's annoying going through every single photo later and check whether you like them or not so you don't take random photos at a place where's basically nothing. Third, this was a jungle, their hands were probabaly sweating and they must've been tired. Why would they photograph if they didn't have to? Forth, those are young girls we talk about. I'm a girl and we usually care about how we look, what and why we photograph, we want to give emotions, meaning and story to a photo. I would never photograph my friend turned back on a camera because there isn't a usual reason for it. \n\nWhy didn't Kris stop and take a photo of Lisanne as well? At every place they took a photo it was both of them who were there. Suddenly it's only Kris at several photos. \n\nWhy would they take 10 of 100 photos on April 1st, then 7 days nothing and then 90 photos during night on April 8th?",

        "text": "The evidence clearly shows that it was murder because of the clean cut above the one girl's ankle and skin rolled into a ball? How would anyone know that detail other than the murderer or the victim. But how many people were involved. Like how did the woman find the backpack that turned it in. The taxi driver mixing up the time he dropped off the girls. Was it deliberately done or did he really believe the time he stated was the correct time. \n\nBut all the attempts to call for help suggests to me they were being followed by someone or something had already happened to one or both of them. Since they say the attempt to get help begins early on. But also someone had no knowledge of what the password to the phone was. So, one or both could have been seriously injured or dead near the beginning of their trip into the jungle. \n\nBut why no photos with the dog they were supposed to be walking. The dog made it back home, but the girls didn't. In the photos it doesn't even look like they're walking a dog. But perhaps it was sitting out of view as the girls took random pictures. \n\nBut the sudden shift from happy day photos of the girls to night photos of just wilderness is odd. Can it be confirmed they were taken in the same general area? Doesn't seem like it based on the information supplied. None of the night photos show the girls or anyone else. \n\nIt is possible 2 girls could have met someone most likely a local or someone familiar with the area could have offered to be their guide. But if that's the case whomever that person or group is they made the girls feel comfortable assuming the girls met them towards the beginning of their trip into the jungle. Cause at certain points both girls are in the photo together so who is taking the photo of them then? Ok maybe they set a timer, perhaps but at the angle the photo was taken if a timer was used a high enough rock or something would have to have been available to set the camera on. Otherwise someone else was already hiking along with them during their first few moments of happiness on the hike snapping pictures of themselves. \n\nSome of the photos clearly indicate one of the girls was holding the camera or phone while both were in view. Cause the camera shot shows their arms extended as far as possible as i have done myself trying to take a selfie in similar fashion to what appears in some of their photos. \n\nBut the photos where only one girl is seen. It is possible the other girl took those photos, but someone else could have done that too because they remain hidden out of sight. So, maybe the girl not seen in the photos where only one is visible took those pictures, but then again why is there only one girl visible? \n\nGiven the circumstances that someone obviously cut one of their feet off cleanly. Likely is the same person that removed their SIM cards and deleted a photo (or photos) \n\nAnd maybe that is the reason why they could not get any response from emergency services because their sim cards were removed. But at one point they  did or someone did briefly make a connection with emergency services. But the call was either dropped or whomever had control over the phone ended the call.  If it was the girls they would not have deliberately ended the call. Someone else up to no good would have been motivated to turn off the phone and remove the SIM cards and delete photos. \n\nObviously someone else was involved. Cause i don't think it is very easy to cut off your own foot. And why would anyone cut off their own foot? Maybe if they're trapped in something and their foot is caught and if they don't cut off their foot they will never escape. But that theory doesn't make sense. Since there apparently wasn't anything to indicate the girl was trapped or needed to cut off her own foot. \n\nBut the staging of the 1 shoe from each girl couldn't have been done by the girls themselves especially if they were already dead. And if the girls were both still in possession of both their shoes 1 of each shoe wouldn't also be missing. But why take a random shoe. To prevent someone from running away? Perhaps but anyone that wasn't dead and was determined enough to get away from danger would find a way to escape with or without their shoes, or bra, or cellphone. \n\nBut the fact the bag was found dry during a rainy period and near the river edge. Suggests someone only fabricated where it was found. Cause if it was outside for a month or two it would shows signs of damage, but according to the report it looked brand new. \n\nThis is another bit of evidence that shows another person was involved because the bag was turned in by some woman. But why did she have it and how did she know where to get it. She said it wasn't wherever it was found a day before. That could just be a convenient story to throw people off. Or maybe it is absolutely true. But it is odd just the same and it does show someone else was involved maybe the woman and the taxi driver were involved somehow. Or perhaps another person. \n\nBut a combination of things may have happened perhaps one of them got injured and then someone took advantage of the vulnerability and attacked them. \n\nIn any case someone else was involved. Therefore it isn't just an accident. \n\nMost people that go into the woods that doesn't have a suicide thought or doesn't get injured or murdered and isn't lost. They usually return within a few hours at most. That applies to the majority of people. Most people return safe from a hike in the woods. Generally most ambitious people don't plan to jump off a cliff to die, or get eaten by a bear or murdered. They plan to enjoy themselves and go home and earn lots of money and spend time with family and friends and maybe return to college or university or to work or just to return home to see family members or kids etc. \n\nThe fact the girls didn't bring a lot of supplies and no camping stuff tells me they planned on returning at some point. But weren't planning to go on a short trip either. Cause they did bring some amount of supplies so they did intend to be away for a good portion of the day. If i was only going around the block walking a dog i wouldn't need food or drinks or to pack extra clothes or a camera etc. but since these girls were away from home it makes sense they would have their passports, but why would you only bring 1 of them for the hike, and why only 1 insurance card? But 1 of each for separate girls. Suggests either someone lost theirs, it was stolen, or those things weren't seen as necessary and left behind at the place they were staying. Personally i don't care how trustworthy someone else is i would not leave my passport and insurance card and ID just laying around. So, it makes sense the girls will bring those things along, but what does not make sense is why 1 passport and 1 insurance card but not all for the same girl. A woman is more likely to steal another woman's passport than a man because another woman is more likely to have a chance of looking like the other woman. But a man not possible. Although a man might steal a woman's stuff and maybe keep it as some sort of trophy, souvenir, or to sell to someone, or just take it to inconvenience the other person. \n\nBut if a woman was involved the 2 girls probably would have let their guards down then if it was a man and woman working together the man could have over powered the unsuspecting girls. \n\nNo way of knowing for sure what the hell happened exactly, but it is obvious someone else was involved. I don't necessarily like the look of my feet, but in spite of that i would not go hacking off my foot  and leave it in the woods. Then vanish not to be seen again while sipping margaritas on the beach in Panama without a foot. So, i doubt those girls would have deliberately hurt themselves then staged a scene to make it appear like they were murdered. Like their remains were found and some personal items. But how things were found and displayed points to someone else did it. Because if you found the 2 girls even if they're dead likely you would find both their shoes at the scene too. Especially how well they were laced up on the girl that had her foot cut off at the ankle. \n\nMaybe the random night photos were in order to see at night. But why not just wait until daylight and walk out the way they walked in? Can't walk without your foot. And can't walk away if you're already dead.",

        "text": "Seeing the Photo's shown and discussed here brings to focus the mystery of missing Photo #509... Put aside your emotional investment and preconceptions on the Disappearance of these two friends, and instead imagine yourself as the Panamanian who either finds, or is handed, this camera... What would your immediate actions be with this device?\r\n\r\nIn general there are three or four instances in the accepted timeline of the camera's discovery of people who could be responsible for the fate of Photo #509. \r\nThe first person to consider as possibly being responsible is the person who originally had possession of the backpack of the two friends, and likely placed it on the banks by Alto Romero to be 'found'. The second may be someone IN Alto Romero, curious about this found backpack and what is on that camera. The third in the chain might be the Police whom the Guide handed it over to. The Fourth might be the Media persons who gained access to the Camera's memory card two or three days after it was handed into the police's hands... indeed while these are the four main considerations as to who may have interfered with the cards content and deleted Photo #509 before it was handed over the Dutch authorities, the reality is - the whole business it a complete mystery. We CAN only speculate.\r\n\r\nBut there are still basic truths here I feel. With a Memory card that may well contain around 200 or more images anyone curious about the camera's secrets would find that using the camera's own view-screen to look at the images is a chore. A better and instant overview of its content would come by accessing the Memory card on a computer or laptop, where the windows file explorer or any Image editing programme would allow thumbnails of ALL of the contents to be viewed at once, and the Photograph of choice easily accessed for a better look.\r\nSo imagine yourself as being one of these potential people accessing the Cards content, looking at the content you have an overview of thumbnails showing the flow of the images on the card, from the earliest showing these two girls setting off on the flight, to the many holidaying snaps and selfie's and good times being had, moving to the end of this run of bright daytime run, and a sudden change into black night photographs... a very dramatic change to be sure. \r\nWhat would your actions be here if you were one of these people in Panama with perhaps little or no knowledge of who these two girls pictured are?\r\n\r\nThe act of speaking about missing Photo #509 tends to get bogged down in wondering whether the image itself held something Important, and questions as to whether it was a deliberate act it disappeared or an accidental one. And yet if you put yourself in front of this folder on your computer showing the long rows of thumbnails of the images on that card, you inevitably will move your attention to the last of those images, the ones before the black nothingness of the night-time ones, and want to take a closer look... Photo #509 is generally accepted as being an image taken just after the final images at the stream, possibly showing another shot AT the stream or possibly a little further on somewhere, depending which direction the two girls decided to take. So if you are one of the people in Panama viewing these thumbnails on your computer and Photo #509 was one the very first of the night-time images you would not be likely to select it for attention as those black images generally held nothing at all of interest. If photo #509 was final daytime image before those night images though.... well yes, this is an image you might want to look at but more than that you would select that image as you see there is something interesting on it. In all fairness ALL of the final images of April 1st are 'interesting' and worth opening up and looking at, but apart from it being the final image of the daytime photographs #509 had to have held something more interesting still than the ones coming before it, as while some do ask whether it may have been 'cut' accidentally I myself don't find that a credible or realistic possibility. To 'Cut' you have to right-click and press cut, and even then your mistake is reversable. You can reverse the 'cut'. \r\n\r\nNo, whoever did cut that image from the card did so very deliberately. Because of what it showed.\r\nALL of those final images on the daytime run of Photo's are worth inspection, they are all interesting, therefore any one of them could have been similarly 'cut'. But it was that final photograph that was targeted. And whoever did it believed that no one who inspected the camera and content would ever even suspect it had ever even existed - and there perhaps is another interesting point to think on. Whoever did it thought they were erasing it from all existence. No one would ever know there had even been a final photograph on April 1st other than the one left on the card showing Kris Kremers looking back at us ambiguously...\r\nSetting that aside however the images following on from these though are the 90 night-time images. Imagine yourself opening the card, looking though the thumbnails on your computer, and all these dark meaningless images blending into one. Except for perhaps five. Five images that stand out in neon against the rest of those black dark shots as they show something lit up. The Boulder, the SoS display, Kris Kremers' fiery hair... any one of these is going to get your immediate attention. But are not worthy of 'cutting'? Even the image of Kris Kremers hair is fine as it is? You leave it all alone, you want the authorities to see THIS particular image, along with the ones on the last hike on that sunny day, but NOT image #509. Why? You have to ask on the motives at work here... as it really could be telling you something in itself. Just that one image out of 200-plus?\r\n\r\nIt only makes the fact #509 was the sole target for deletion all the more tantalising and telling. The one picture on that card, out of 200-plus images, that HAD to disappear.",

        "text": "We did a lot of investigation on this case.\n    1. The night photos were all taken in the same spot. The girls were NOT moving location..\n    2. There is no \"missing\" photo 509. This error happened when the SD card was removed and attempted to take a photo resulted in a count going from 508 to 509 but no photo is saved because no sd was in the camera. Then the sd card was put back in for photo 510+\n    3. Only a few bones were found bleached, not all of them. Leanne's foot was found inside one of her shoes that still had flesh on it. This to me sounds like insects and animals couldnt get to the flesh because the shoe was in the way.\n      4. The phone calls were roughly made at around the same time if the day each day. Close to sunrise.\n      5. The theory is Kris had their only water bottle cramed into her front pocket. A bad place to put your obly water bottle. Seen in photo 506.\n      6. The location of the night photos has not been definitively located. But assumed they made it to the first monkey bridge where one or both had an accident and they never left that location.\n     7. The night photos were an attempt to light up the tree canopy above them to help reach a further distance to signal anyone who might be out searching for them. A signal beacon.\n      8. Why didnt the beacon work? It was late and raining, no one was out on the trail.\n     9. The backpack found was wet despite what some claim. Kris's phone had to be professionally dried before it could be analyzed. Meaning taken appart to dry out the electronics.\n      10. We think they passed a way near the river/streams edge and heavy rains flash flooded the stream carrying their bodies down stream.\n      11. No signs of foul play. Money found in the backpack wasnt taken. Their cellphones could have been sold or destroyed to hide any potential evidence. The canera could have also been taken, sold or desteoyed to hide evidence.\n     12. A kidnapper would most likely take their shoes from them. This prevents two things, harder to run a way without shoes on. And shoes make for decent defensive weapons. A SA would take their shoes, but they found the shoes near their bones.\n    13. All credulous claims about edited photos have been debunked.\n     14. Why would a person take an sd card, delete 1 photo using a computer then put it back in the backpack? Just delete them all. The mystery ends up the same. \"Damaged camera deleted the data off the sd card\" See one mystery is easily compounded.",

        "text": "It is interesting how Kris was unsmiling and looked uneasy in her last photo at the river. Given the mood of their previous photos, they should both have been ideally standing on those rocks together smiling and taking photos together. The fact that this particular photo shows Kris alone at a distance on the river looking back with an uneasy expression on her face is a cause for concern. Even if she had instructed Lisanne to take a solo photo of her, she should have at least been smiling and posing because she was comfortable in her friend's company. This leads me to believe that they had already encountered their assailant(s) at this time. Perhaps it was the assailant behind the camera taking a photo of Kris for whatever reason hence her worried expression. The argument that they got lost holds no water simply because of the state some of their remains were found in and the detective is right, they would have left at least a message or something narrating what went wrong. Their bodies would also have been found intact because they would probably have died of starvation if they got lost in the jungle. The night photos are the biggest puzzle in my opinion. It makes no sense at all that they would suddenly decide to use the camera as a flash to illuminate the way after all those days. Even if that is the case, it doesn't explain the photos of the sky or kris' hair with hints of blood on it. I actually thought that that photo could have been Kris herself holding the camera behind her head to try and take a picture of the wound in order to assess the damage. If that is true, then it means that she must have been alone at this point and was probably taking pictures of the sky as a way to try and signal her position to Lisanne or potential search teams whom she would probably have expected to be on the lookout for them. The photos of the surrounding could then imply that something or someone was lurking nearby and she was trying desperately to see who/what it was. Based on the evidence, i know for a fact that it was murder. The only questions that remain unanswered are who did it, how they did it, why they did it and the location of the rest of the remains.",

        "text": "I'm sceptical of the murder theories, although they're understandable, given past crimes involving young women hikers in foreign countries. I have myself been seriously lost in the woods twice, and once guided out a young woman lost in the woods at night while I was camping just off the Appalachian trail. Each time it was dramatic how fast disorientation and panic set in - it's the panic-fear that makes one automatically do the opposite of what one should do. It's not like your car's GPS stops working on a road trip. It's more like falling off a cruise ship and watching it disappear over the horizon. I can only infer that in the most serious cases, especially after days of food deprivation and chronic anxiety and stress, disorientation could become so severe that the two inexperienced girls in the Panama case would begin acting almost pathologically confused, while desperate hope may have led them to forego goodbye messages for the sake of attempts to reach local rescue until the batteries in their phones went dead and it was too late.\n\nI've watched a couple of the better pieced-together videos and I found myself getting sceptical of the murder theories when I saw too much bias in that direction. For example, some of the \"happy\" photos early on in their hike were slightly distorted or the clouds seemed mis-timed from one snap to the next or the one girl was supposedly a little depressed or anxious looking, and to me all that seemed overly subjective and irrelevant to any criminal activity. The idea of any killers allowing their victims to keep taking photos is ridiculous, not just because it creates possible evidence but because abduction and murder (rape also) is about having complete power and control over someone.\n\nWhy would a killer and not the girls turn the phones on and off? Only the girls had any reason to do that repeatedly, and if they had the chance to do so around an abductor, they also would have had the chance to escape. The backpack could have been misplaced by the girls in their disoriented state until a villager found and took it, then returned it, dry, to the same (or a different) spot once they got wind of rescue efforts for the owner of the backpack and realized it might implicate them in more than just “finders, keepers.”\n\nAs for the photos in the camera, how would taking dozens of photos of the sky at night serve to mislead police? And the height-distorted photo of Lisanne? Digital photos occasionally are goofy like that (I have a rear-view pic of my motorcycle where the panniers look like two different sizes). The clouds at the trail overlook completely mismatching in photos taken seconds apart? Weird, but how does that suggest foul play, when the girls are posing normally? The deleted photo? A tech-savvy killer would only take the batteries out of the phones and throw everything in the river or bury it all, making deleting photos unnecessary and also increasing the mystery to the killer’s advantage. Anyways, why disguise a murder as an accident, when both possibilities (murder or losing their way) are going to be speculated about regardless? I can certainly see the girls using the camera flashes to attempt signalling toward airplane sounds and checking for hazards in their path (note the one photo of a dangerous drop down a rock). Furthermore, why would a killer force-march two victims miles through a jungle, only to kill them in the middle of nowhere? That makes no sense - killers aren't lazy, but what advantage would there be to the killer?\n\nI think these girls just got hopelessly lost, and that leads me back to my own experiences of being lost in the woods - the more you try to guess your way out in a panicked and confused state of mind, the more lost you get. To me, the most important thing about this tragedy isn't how the girls died, but the decisions they made leading up to their disappearance. They'd worked hard as waitresses in the Netherlands to save for the trip and they were young, idealistic and eager, so it's understandable they'd be adventurous. But they'd already reached their goal of living in that small tropical town in Panama and they hadn't even seriously explored the town itself yet. They had a guided hike scheduled for the next day. What was the hurry to get into the jungle? Going to extremes is always a dangerous thing, and getting too adventurous too soon was going to an extreme. I think the girls were their own killers.",

        "text": "I am almost certain the night photos show the stars and not rain as most people have assumed.  This is why the ground and Kris' hair is dry when people thought it was rain in the photo's.  You can see the same constellations in many of the night photos.  Using this info. someone should now be able to now locate their last location.   They may have left a message at his place.\r\n\r\nThere only needs to be a search of waterways upstream from where the bones were found.  It is less than 5km to the highest point of the mountain from this place.\r\n\r\nI believe the night photo's were to help us find their last location as most photo's are of what I initially thought was the North star.  That is where the large V shaped tree is.  (I need help with the star identification)  \r\n\r\nThe large V shaped tree seems to be quite unusual.  If you look at drone footage (On YT) of this area.  There does not look to be that many of these trees close to creeks.  This may assist to find the location of the night photos.\r\n\r\nMy initial thought was they were at the base of an old or currently dry waterfall (I think the water comes from the south or west) If true this will explain bag, shoes etc. being found weeks later after a wet season washed it downstream.\r\n\r\nSome of the night photos may also have the moon in them.  You can check the moon charts and it seems to line up with the photos.  This may help to find the location.\r\n\r\nNight photo of Kris' hair - You can see her black triangular earing at the bottom of the night photo of her hair. (towards the right) She had these on in the earlier beach photos.  All the photo experts can now do some analysis and super imposing to check this. Need to also check she had these on this day. I checked the lookout photos and they do appear black. I think this makes the pink skin in the middle/bottom Kris' left cheek so I think it is her left ear. It appears Lisanne has covered Kris up (with her hair) out of respect for her friend.\r\n\r\nHopefully we can find the location of the night photos.\r\n\r\nRIP K&L",

        "text": "You've thought of this a lot and put a much effort into it. Interesting ideas and angles you discuss. Here are some notes I took while watching. 1) What was the tour guide and taxi driver's schedule? Could they verify their whereabouts during these 11 days? 2) How could they have come back like the American states if there's evidence of them traveling for up to 11 days? 3) Using the camera for light would not only burn up the battery but also would not require flash. Perhaps they didn't have the flashlight app on their phone. The picture of Kris's head looked very fake as if it was a wig. Her hair was not curly like that and the color looks a little off. Didn't look real in my opinion. I can see someone wanting it as a \"souvenir\" but it was on their phone so he wouldn't have access to it once it was found. Were the attempts to get in someone's phone an attempt to look at the photos and see if anything was incriminating? 4) How far were the bones from each other? 5) What is on photo 508 and 510? 6) The photos showing Kris in the distance, where is her backpack? 7) Did they both take dark photos? 8) What order are the photos in meaning when were the dark photos compared to the distance photos etc. 9) What would cause the fracture that Lisanne had in her foot? 10) I didn't see any distant photos of Lisanne. Were they all of Kris? 11) If those \"distance\" photos were not being taken by one of the girls then how could he have found them starving and dehydrated in the forest? Those photos indicate he was traveling with them for awhile and Kris looked okay. 12) I need more clarity on the timeline of the photos and when we think the girls may have been followed or abducted. 13) How far away is the tour guide's coffee farm from the bones, the backpack, the first fun photos etc. 14) Was he still working as a guide during these 11 days? How could he have been in so many places at once? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the timeline. Do you have it written somewhere? That'd be great!",

        "text": "In one photo, blonde girl (Kris?) has her legs crossed while standing and one hand on her waist, looking at the camera with a kind of disappointed yet a little angry face expression (like, why am I here?). Some women stand on crossed legs when they don't know the people around them, so more closed type of stance which also can mean access to genital areas is denied. It just gives some kinda clue that there was a third party with them in their last pictures. Maybe that's why they never had photos together again because they were unhappy with the situation. Until this point, it would be safe to say Lisa was alive whether Lisa was taking the photos or a third party. Because Kris would not be that calm in photos if Lisa wasn't alive or in trouble. What comes to my mind is, the tour guide Feliciano goes to where Kris and Lisa stayed, the next morning. Meaning, whatever happened, already happened up until that point. He had enough time to lure the girls to go off track and a little more into the jungle, do whatever he could and hide them at his coffee farm in the middle of jungle. And then, go to the girls' hostel next morning as if he knows nothing about them. Yes, i agree we shouldn't just blame people without evidence, but human instincts tell me this is way too fishy to be an accident or getting lost scenario. These girls were two young, strong, intelligent adult women coming from a developed country to have fun and holiday, knowing enough about not getting deep into the the wilderness of the jungle alone and means of emergency. In other words, they would have turned back when they felt something was wrong before even calling emergency. But they didn't. Someone or something forced them to go deeper in the jungle. No one is that stupid. Even two adult guys without proper equipment and experience would definitely not go deep in an unknown jungle or forest to them. And you just can't lose your way in a one-way track, come on. A kid could go back from the same track if they think they got lost.  My theory is, the guide Feliciano and/or his son(s) followed the girls up until the summit. Then, Feliciano shows up (alone or not) and greets the girls, tells them he is happy to be there with them and he can show around. Girls think, it is around noon, a sunny clear day and it is not someone else but the guide they had reservation with anyway. The last photos are taken after this point showing only Kris and she seems unsettled, has these suspicious-vague looks in her face in the photos. I won't analyze the whole event details because in this video any in many others it's been analyzed over and over but lastly, the guy saying in Spanish \"I told you not to tell them anything\" just makes it jackpot, bingo, whatever you call it. And you know those trivial movies where they show one specific suspect for the murder and the killer turns out someone nobody expected? Well, 1) This is not a movie, 2) This is not happening in a closed environment with certain amount of people. 3) How many people can kill and shed the bodies away from police in the middle of a jungle? Only locals. The tour guide and his sons or the local villagers? Many arrows point at the tour guide. Him, alone or with his people. Just get them to talk, it's never too late. I just learned about this incident yesterday while surfing on the net. I felt so sorry for the girls and their parents, i couldn't sleep all night but kept reading and watching. If i were the parents of those girls, i would do whatever i can to make that sob tour guide talk and i am really honest with this. I would start with taking him for a walk in his own jungle. And who knows, maybe hours later, he would be the one trying to call the emergency numbers...I just looked at the crossed legs photo again. If you look closely, you will notice that the photo seems like it is taken at Kris' height level. We know Lisa is 184cm, much taller so at the terrain level, the top of Kris' head and whatever behind her should be visible if Lisa had taken Kris' photo while standing, but it is not. However, the tour guide is about Kris' height and if he took this photo, it would look normal height wise. Or maybe, Lisa kneeled down to take her photo. Last option is they were walking uphill which would only mean they were heading back to the summit when this photo was taken.  Another thing i remembered reading was the shoe of (Lisa?) with her foot in it being a clean cut in police records. No animal can do a clean cut even if they manage to bite her foot off of her body which is highly unlikely unless there is a bear or a tiger type of an animal. No falling can just chop off your limbs from your body in a jungle. Come on, this is not a plane crash with 300mph from 10,000 feet. But instead, a machete could perform this clean cut, just like Feliciano performed it on trees while he was guiding Kris' mother and others in the jungle.",

        "text": "My unique idea - I think the first part of the hike was very pleasant very happy. However I think it’s possible that F then stayed around the area to if others are going on the same path. Once he understood that no more hikers were coming he then quickly race to the girls but made it seem as if it was a pure coincidence that he was also walking through at that time. He then offered to show the girls his farm in the middle of the forest and probably claimed that there was some good scenery to take photos. This is potentially proven by the change in behaviour in the photos naturally when you’re with a friend or someone you know you can be yourself you can smile you can laugh. However when does the third-party that that you are not familiar with or is a stranger to you you start to act shy reserved and you’re often careful of how you behave. The missing picture is between the daytime and the night time- The last photos are taken of one girl only. It’s impossible to determine whether they have a girl took the photo or whether it was F when they were on their way to the middle of the jungle so that he could show them his farm. This would’ve been a good technique to prove to the girls that he was just being friendly while allowing them to the middle of the jungle by offering to take pictures of them on the way.  The missing photo 509 could be one of two things the first possibility could be that it was a picture of both of the girls this would prove that there was a third-party with them and therefore is deleted because it clearly shows that someone else was there and the second theory would be one of the photos was taken of F and one of the other girls by the other girl this would then put him at the scene. If his intention was to lead them into the middle of the jungle it would’ve been difficult for him to give a reason why he didn’t want to be in any photos and him being in a photo with the girls would have only made them trust him more. Also I would like to know but it’s impossible to determine the circumstance in which 911 or 112 was dialled. We often see that emergency numbers are dialled when not in obvious panic. If the girls suspected that F was getting awkward or there was a uneasy feeling it’s quite possible that they could have dialled it secretly. Hence the gaps in calls. Although gaps in calls could symbolise the need to preserve battery it could also show that they were trying to call in secret while with a third-party for example one of the girls was distracting him while another girl was trying to secretly dial 112 so that the authorities would know that there is something going on - in hopes that the authorities would be able to secretly listen to the conversation maybe while the phone was in the pocket and determine the location where they were. Ultimately I believe at one point F wanted a sexual favour in which the girls declined and run or there was a plan folder together when things started to go wrong where the girls would go run. This then causes the girls to hide in shallow ditches through the forest or behind trees in which they made panic calls to 911. When you are hiding and when you are running from somebody you have no time to to text or record a final message. With residents saying that they had scrims from the forest this could possibly be because a machete was used to run off to the girls or one of the girls was slaughtered hence the screams. Is also possible that one girl was killed and another girl was then taken to a secret spot in the forest and raped and then kept alive and slowly over the days was was cut with the machete which would explain the fresh skin because skin does not compose if the person is alive. It is also quite possible that somewhere in the forest one of the girls could be tied up or chained up without a leg and with skin cut of her.",

When I told him about the photos (of basically nothing/darkness) being taken in the middle of the night, 90 photos within seconds of each other, he said that sounds like possibly a person from a tribe who has maybe never seen of used a camera before, testing it out. Like a child with a camera. The photo of the back of Kris' head also struck me as obviously the creepiest, but why would that photo be taken? The theories were maybe she was injured and Lisanne took a photo for whatever reason. But we don't see any photos of Lisanne after early on. These are young, pretty Dutch girls who were naive and probably very trusting. Maybe they encountered tribesmen. Maybe the photos of night were taken by inexperienced tribesmen. Maybe one of them took a photo of the back of Kris' head, because they were fascinated by her strawberry blonde/red hair. Beyond that, I believe they were r.ped, killed, and if it was a cartel, possibly organ harvested. I don't give much to the supernatural/spirits theories, although I haven't read much about them. I'm open minded, but also realistic. Odds are, it was a man, or men.",

Between the last photo taken on the day they went missing, and the first of the night time photos, there is a missing photo number. If I’m not mistaken, it goes from 508 to 510. This photo was not recoverable, which means it wasn’t just deleted from the camera, but from the memory card. Of the hundreds of photos on the camera, it is the ONLY missing one. Also, it had to have been deleted AFTER the night time April 8 photos had been taken, otherwise the first of those would have become 509, and there would be no missing photo. It was found impossible for this to be a camera error. So, if someone can explain THAT, I’ll buy it is an accident.\nAnd just some more food for thought that wasn’t mentioned...where did those bracelets lisanne is wearing come from? At first on their hike she isn’t wearing them, then suddenly she is...",

        "text": "Okay, bare with me. But this is my theory on what happened to these two poor young ladies. I believe something happened between 13:20 and 13:54. The contrast between the photos taken at this time show Kris pulling a silly face, sticking her tongue out and posing without care, to her displaying an awkward stance, with a serious expression, perhaps concerned. It looks like it went from having fun to not enjoying themselves at this point, between these 34 minutes. Could be that they were fed up of the walk, having gone further than planned and realised they were lost. They hadn’t planned on a long hike, as they didn’t have a large supply of drinking water, nor spare clothing if the weather changed. They seemed like smart girls with travelling experience, so I don’t think they would have simply taken these chances without planning. Someone encountered them after the photos at 13:20. They took possession of the camera and led them deeper into the rain forest, snapping shots of Kris, forcing her to pose, and keeping Lisa out of view, either to create the illusion that Lisa was taking them as they continued their walk, or this was a strange form of torture. Maybe the stranger had offered to take photos but the girls became uncomfortable, the person became agitated. Because, following the photos at 13:54 when Kris doesn’t seem to be smiling like she is in all the previous photos, and it being further past the trail than they had planned or been advised to go, that’s when the photo which was deleted occurred. Perhaps the person taking the photo accidentally captured one of themselves, maybe even just their own finger which could have given away the evidence that the girls were not alone. Or somehow the girls had taken the camera back and taken a snap of this person. Maybe they were arguing with them, stating that they didn’t want to be followed or joined any more by this person. Could be they didn’t mind the company to begin with, not expecting the person to want to tag along for longer than a couple of minutes, or could be they felt obliged to be friendly to a local person but felt awkward. The stranger becomes offended, and with agitation he threatens them. One of the girls takes a photo of them. This aggravates the stranger, and they snatch the camera back and delete the pic. Maybe the girls tried to take the camera back and this person attacks them. It escalates. He hits Kris or uses a weapon. Maybe she is knocked unconscious. Or she is killed. He then does the same to Lisa. Maybe they were bound, sexually assaulted - no evidence of this, but it’s a possibility - and killed. Perhaps, during the time in which they are being followed or led away, the girls tried calling the emergency services to no avail. By the time the person caught up with them, or realised they had been making calls, these calls stopped, the phones being taken from them. Or they were faked by the third party themselves. After the girls were killed, I believe their bodies were taken away. This leads to the theory that there would have been more than one attacker to carry the bodies and belongings away. Whatever the reason, whether needing to get rid of evidence following an opportunist murder, or for some satanic ritual including potential cannibalism, or an act of organ trade, the bodies were then disposed of: skinned (perhaps consumed by human or animal assistance), dismembered, bones shattered into smaller pieces. The bones were bleached, perhaps to remove evidence, perhaps out of some psychopathic act of cherishing their “trophy kill”. This explains the severed foot (by machete, common use in the Panamanian jungle), the rolled up skin, the bleached pelvis bone, the other thirty or so bone particles discovered over a stretch of land. These were all saved and deliberately placed further from where the girls were killed, including the backpack which was dry and in perfect condition, bras neatly stacked inside, having been removed when the women were possibly assaulted, and in any case when killed, neither of which would have occurred if the backpack was left in the rain forest for as many weeks as it was suggested - since the time of the girls coming into trouble and making calls; nor would the body parts have naturally decomposed in a natural environment the way they did if left in the jungle - they were preserved, and saved for a later moment to be discovered to confuse the officials and public. The perpetrator used the camera to take the confusing nighttime photos in sporadic succession days after the girls were killed, to suggest the girls were alive and had taken the themselves. I fail to believe these photos were taken by either girl - so many days had passed since the hike and emergency calls, and they had no water source, nor food, not to mention suffering with the heat and the heaving rain. Perhaps the hair was always saved and used in this pic to appear as though she is still in the jungle at this point. Hair doesn’t die with the rest of the body when decomposing. Kris’s phone was plugged in by whoever had possession of this in the following days after their kidnap/murder, desperately attempting to access the phone, either to delete photos in fear of there being any evidence, or for sheer curiosity, wanting to invade the girl’s private life more than they already had. Maybe someone knew they were heading into the forest and followed them, or let slip to another stranger of their whereabouts, such as the tour guide or taxi driver. Their items in the backpack such as the knife and compass which were missing were simply stolen by whomever took their belongings. It could be that the items were left when the girls were taken away and were later found/stolen by someone else, only to realise who it belonged to and returned them to the forest in fear of being accused of having involvement. Police did a poor job with solving the case either because: a) they were confused with all the events and lazily failed at tying it together, b) they don’t want it solved due to the knowledge that a third party involvement of their nationality would create negative media coverage, affecting tourism which the community heavily relies on as a main source for income, or c) perhaps the police were even involved/aware of the specifics of the crime, if such a thing as organ trade or human trafficking were prevalent in the area. Terrible story, horrifies me and makes me so sad to know they were out there enjoying a holiday with their best friend, to end up the way they did. True horror story material. Awful. I just hope the girls had each other for longer than predicted or I can figure out, that they looked after each other as best they could - it’s horrible to know they loved each other and were in that situation together, maybe one having to see the other be killed, or each other be assaulted/killed. I hope someone can come forward and shed light onto what happened, that the case can be solved the way it deserves to be, and the girls can be put to rest, the families can have answers and the person(s) responsible can face serious brutal  justice.",

        "text": "No one could ever be 100% sure of what really happened to these 2 girls, but to me the fact that they just had an accident and that no foul play was involved it's very unlikely to me.\nI think that the answer of what really happened it's in that photo in their camera that's been deleted. I mean, that specific photo is the photo between their last \"normal\" photo taken on April 1st while they were apparently normally hiking, and the start of the series of mysterious night photos presumably taken on April 8th. It might be just a coincidence, but damn, there are MANY weird coincidences in this story. It's also believed how that photo has been deleted using a computer software. Yes, it could have been the police, but if it was really the police to delete that photo, i don't think it's been an accident. I mean, how can you delete a photo in a computer software by accident? You should select the photo, click on 'delete' and then confirm. And even if it really was an accident, it's a hell of a coincidence that it was only that specific photo to have been deleted, don't you think? If it was really the police who deleted the photo it was to cover up something or someone.",

        "text": "On every true crime video, it seems there's someone who comments how out of the many, many true crime cases they've watched, THAT one is the that sticks with them the most. This is that case for me--well, tied with the whole Turtle Island Thailand gang-corruption-coverup murders haha. \n\nAny theory on this case (or derivative) get be picked apart so it's frustrating. Some things start to make sense in your mind, it's all clicking together, and then you go \"but wait, what about the ___ \" So yeah the only thing i'm certain of is that i'm not certain. I do notice however, that people who support the theory that they just got lost (whether coupled with an animal attack, a fall of a cliff, effects of dehydration etc.) don't seem able or willing to refute arguments for the (a) foul play theory. \n\nEven to believe they were kidnapped by a gang would open up so many more questions that have left people scratching their heads. But I tend to lean towards some form of the foul play theory, and here why.\n\nPoints that contradict the theory that they just got lost:\n\n1) the backpack -- it was found 70 days after the girls' disappearance, beside a river bank 15 km away from the pianista trail. The lady who found it said she was at the same spot the day before but didn't see any backpack there. The backpack was NOT wet -- it was in pristine condition and the items inside were dry and appeared untouched. The phones and digital camera were in there, so it becomes difficult to see how the girls could've been the ones taking the pictures and calling emergency services in the jungle for 11 days, and yet the backpack doesn't get wet or dirty, and somehow makes a long journey on its own without getting wet. \n\n2) Lisanne's severed left foot was found in her hiking boot, and the cut was clean -- This disproves any animal attack theory and shows a human being cut off her foot. Unless Pokemon are real and a Scyther jumped out and cut her foot off, then it was a human. It can't be argued that an animal could have done that, plus the boot was clean and still tied to her foot, with no sign of scratches or claw marks\n\nHonestly, I don't see how anyone can believe they just got lost given the above 2 points. Ok let's tack on some more for goal differential :P\n\n3) Pictures -- I'm hoping people have watched/read other things about this case, to gather more details. The daytime pictures and nighttime pictures tell completely different (albeit incomplete) stories. \n\nTimeline: they start their hike on April 1st. Yikes, I didn't even notice that was April Fool's, ugh. \n\n-> daytime pictures - The girls are smiling. These are the ones at the foot of the trail, along it and leading up to them reaching the peak where I wish they had been able to turn back. In the strange pictures of Kris beside the stream of water and crouched by the bushes, she's not smiling at all and some believe at this point they were either kidnapped or had run into another group and knew they were dangerous.\n\n These initial pictures were taken before 1:30-2:00pm, so that refutes the taxi driver saying he dropped them off at that time. Nope, he might've just misremembered but this notion that they started their hike at 2pm is simply false. MORE on that taxi driver in a bit ....\n\n> nighttime pictures - After 2pm on April 1st, no one used the camera for 7 days. It just doesn't make sense, if they were alone and simply lost, to not have a SINGLE picture of them, or anything in the daytime for that matter. But then on April 8th, someone took more than 90 photos in less than 3 hours - those hours were between 1am-4am. This is where the \"they just got lost\" camp suggests that these photos were meant to light up the area so they could see their surroundings, perhaps signal an airplane or search party, or perhaps scare off an animal they (or rather just she, by this point) might have heard. I have to admit, whyy would kidnappers be out at 1-4am taking pictures though? Best chance to not be seen as they make it look like the girls took the pictures in the jungle? Oh, I dunno. But then again, WHY was there 0 camera activity for 7 days?\n\nThen there's the deleted photo and this one's a mammoth. Keep in mind that pictures were taken on a digital camera, not their phones. A computer must be used to fully erase a photo, and the Canon company itself confirmed this. It makes a strong argument that the girls managed to get a picture of something or someone incriminating, and whoever kidnapped them (* cough Feliciano Gonzales) had to have deleted the picture. \n\n4) Phones -- alright so on the first day, April 1st, the first emergency call to 112 was placed just after 4:30pm. Then a call was placed to 911 but didn't get through. Then phones turned off for 14 hours. Again, why? If they were lost and had their phones, how do they both go 14 hours without having their phone on? \n\nIn total, they made about 80 calls. On day 5 (April 5th) LIsanne's phone died. Kris's phone stayed on until day 11 but between April 7th-10th Kris's phone was off/had no activity. It was turned on again, for the last time, at 10:51am on April 11th. It was turned off exactly an hour later at 11:51am, and this was the end of any phone activity. \n\nOn April 6th, there were several attempts to enter an incorrect code. There were dozens of attempts up until April 11th. The girls obviously would have exchanged pass codes so it's very unlikely that Lisanne would've been locked out of Kris's phone. Plus, they didn't need a pass code to make an emergency call so investigators concluded it was unlikely to have been Lisanne trying to enter the code. The girls hadn't called home or the place they were staying, or anything other than emergency services in those 11 days so that seemed a bit strange. Why \"dozens\" of attempts to enter a phone, unless it was kidnappers looking for photos or something before they plant the phones in the backpack and leave them by the river. \n\n5) Tour guide / gang members \nOh I gotta wrap this up. No one's reading anyway but I can't sleep so let's write until the eyes get heavy haha. Okay but yeah, let's go over some of these characters.\n\nFeliciano Gonzales - the tour guide\nInternet sleuths like me believe he's our guy. He basically IS a red flag, everything that he does. The girls were supposed to meet with Feliciano but they didn't. So after the girls went missing, he went over to the place they were staying and was in the girls' room for 30 minutes. There wasn't a door key in the backpack that was found, which doesn't make sense. Then of course it's Feliciano who spotted the boot with Lisanne's severed foot in it, and other bones. 33 bones were discovered, one pair of jean shorts, and one shoe from each of the girls. Then there was a rolled up ball of human skin. Then you look at Feliciano's tripadvisor reviews online and the one where he threatens a woman with a machete sticks out. Machete, clean cut above the ankle, hmm. OH, and then the suspicious deaths. Over 10 people connected to the case have died, including 4 member of the Los gang. The one gang member who survived? Henri Elizas Gonzales, Feliciano's son. Alright. \n\nTaxi driver -- named Leonardo Gonzales -- drove the girls to la pianista, told police he saw a pickup truck near where he dropped the girls off. He was found dead in a river, 7 months after the girls' disappearance.\n\nGang member 1 - Osman Velezuales (23 years old) - died April 4th (3 days after the girls' disappearance). \n\n2 - Juan Rivera Miranda (24)\n3 - Jorge Murgas (23)\n4 - Adonis Henriberto (23)\n\nOne was drowned in a shallow pool, one hit and run, and I forget the other. I'm tired, still need to look up another supposed suspect named Plineo Montenegro. \n\nBut yeah, again no one will have read this but forgive the long rant, anyway. This case just has so many strange elements to it. I mean, the girls actually had a compass, a solar power bank, and a knife in their room. They obviously would've taken these if they planned to go on a long hike, which further makes me believe they were intercepted at some point on the trail. \n\nIt just seems obvious that there was foul play involved. Foul play's a euphemism for what Lisanne and Kris went through, and I can't see any way they just got lost. Again they didn't pack much, they didn't take any daytime photos after the first 2 hours of their hike, the condition of the bone fragments, the knowledge of gang/police/government corruption in Panama, all of it. If they were lost, wouldn't they have tried to mark where they've been? It's dense jungle but even little pieces of clothing tied to a tree could be seen by people searching. What about trying to make SOS signs out of rocks or sticks?> Or at least make piles of random sticks and brush so you'll know you've been there before, and people searching can tell a human made those piles. \n\nI dunno, it just seems a bit disrespectful to the girls and their lives to believe they were foolish and got lost. Just think, if Lisanne or Kris was your daughter, would you be able to look at this case and accept that the girls must've just got lost? Evidence for them being lost pales in comparison to them being kidnapped, does it not?\n\nThen again, I could be wrong :)",

No offenders with murderous or sexual intentions would risk being photographed by their victims, or even risk the girls calling the police or leaving a message recorded on their cell phones for when they are found by the authorities.\n\n2- Why don't you have any attempt to call 911 during the night?\n\nWhat would be the worst moment for two girls from an urban environment, lost in the middle of a tropical jungle?\nDo you agree with me that this worst moment would be to spend the night in the forest?! Exhausted, cold, with animals moving on the ground, animal movement in the dark forest, a plague of insects, rain spray, hunger, thirst and darkness everywhere. This would undoubtedly be the time when they would most try to connect to an emergency number, but they didn't.\n\nTrying to explain these two situations, the best way to harmonize was as follows:\nLisanne and Kris decided on their own, to continue the trail past the viewpoint, when they realized they couldn't make it back before nightfall, or because they really got lost and disoriented, they decided to make the first two calls in the late afternoon of April 1st. . Without success, they must surely have screamed for help. They were certainly answered and rescued by someone who heard them both scream, or someone who somehow passed them on the trail. This would explain why the girls did not attempt to call an emergency number during the night, that is, they felt safe to be accompanied by someone they believed to be trustworthy and well intentioned.\nAfter that, they certainly went with that someone, to some nearby property, where they continued to be deceived by lies that reassured them, but that at dawn and after a night's sleep, they always tried to make another emergency call, until the cell phone battery has discharged.\nIt was at that moment that this someone realized that they were totally incommunicado and certainly decided to attack and take their belongings that were all inside the backpack.\nFrom then on, all the evil that befell the girls began.\n\nIn my opinion, between the moment the last cell phone ran out of charge and the dawn of the 8th, Kris Kremers was killed, so in the photos taken on the 8th, only the hair of a lifeless body of Kris appears, trying to simulate a disappearance, with them lost in the night trying to signal their position in the woods and kris dead in Lisanne's arms (who doesn't appear in the photos) as it's the killer planting false evidence, not Lisanne!\n\nAs the pieces of Lisanne Froon's skin were found in mid-June, in an initial state of decomposition, this shows that Lisanne was killed in early June and was under the control of this someone who killed her, for about 60 days. She was the last to die.\n\nNote 1: Seeing the holes in Kris' Jeans, it shows that her dead body was dragged a short distance, where it was thrown. That is, this may indicate that the place where Kris and Lisanne were killed and the bodies were subjected to a chemical treatment for dismemberment and then concealment, are very close to each other, and may be in the vicinity of this property where they felt \"safe\" .\n\nNote 2: The photo of Kris' hair at night, may not have been photographed in the forest, but in a closed and dark environment.\n\nNote 3: Kris' boot found, was it clean and without any remains inside? No animal in the forest, would be interested in carrying a leather boot in her mouth! It's not food! That's how the animals would see this boot, any object, they would have smelled it and gone. That boot was taken to the forest by the killer.\n\nNote 4: The police know of more evidence, maybe even the photo that was deleted. At the very least, they want to make some strategic use.\n\nConclusion: Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon, were held captive in an environment they thought was safe, were killed, stripped naked, with the bodies being dismembered by some chemical process as yet unknown. Some dismembered parts, along with the girls' boots, clothes and backpack with all the girls' belongings, were deliberately abandoned along the straight-line trail to create false leads and simulate that the girls died of hunger and thirst after getting lost in the deep in the forest.\n\nThe death of these innocent girls touched me a lot! This is my small contribution to unravel their deaths and thus lead to a punishment, the possible murderer and the possible collaborators.\n\nFortaleza-CE, Brazil.\n\nI very much hope that Jesus Christ will comfort Kris and Lisanne's parents.",

Et ça peut avoir été fait par les photos de nuit, si tu remplis la carte avec des photos ça va définitivement effacer la photo 509.\n\nDonc en résumé, il faut avoir pris la photo 510 en premier, puis avoir supprimé la 509 (si on fait pas dans cet ordre, il n'y a plus de trou), puis pris toutes les autres. On peut se demander pourquoi avoir pris une photo avant de supprimer la 509. Mais peut-être qu'il y a davantage de photos qui ont été supprimées avant de prendre la 510, et que la 509 a été oubliée dans un premier temps.\nPar exemple on aurait 512 photos à la base, l'assassin supprime de 510 à 512, puis commence à prendre des photos bidon pour remplir la carte (la première sera la 510), puis s'aperçoit qu'il a oublié de supprimer la 509, la supprime, et continu de prendre des photos bidons.\n\nPour savoir qu'un fichier n'est jamais totalement supprimé tant qu'on n'écrit pas par-dessus, il faut avoir un minimum de connaissances en informatique, donc on chercherait plutôt quelqu'un qui côtoie la technologie, pas un habitant de la forêt.",

        "text": "I'm sceptical of the murder theories, although they're understandable, given past crimes involving young women hikers in foreign countries. I have myself been seriously lost in the woods twice, and once guided out a young woman lost in the woods at night while I was camping just off the Appalachian trail. Each time it was dramatic how fast disorientation and panic set in - it's the panic-fear that makes one automatically do the opposite of what one should do. It's not like your car's GPS stops working on a road trip. It's more like falling off a cruise ship and watching it disappear over the horizon. I can only infer that in the most serious cases, especially after days of food deprivation and chronic anxiety and stress, disorientation could become so severe that the two inexperienced girls in the Panama case would begin acting almost pathologically confused, while desperate hope may have led them to forego goodbye messages for the sake of attempts to reach local rescue until the batteries in their phones went dead and it was too late.\n\nI've watched a couple of the better pieced-together videos and I found myself getting sceptical of the murder theories when I saw too much bias in that direction. For example, some of the \"happy\" photos early on in their hike were slightly distorted or the clouds seemed mis-timed from one snap to the next or the one girl was supposedly a little depressed or anxious looking, and to me all that seemed overly subjective and irrelevant to any criminal activity. The idea of any killers allowing their victims to keep taking photos is ridiculous, not just because it creates possible evidence but because abduction and murder (rape also) is about having complete power and control over someone.\n\nWhy would a killer and not the girls turn the phones on and off? Only the girls had any reason to do that repeatedly, and if they had the chance to do so around an abductor, they also would have had the chance to escape. The backpack could have been misplaced by the girls in their disoriented state until a villager found and took it, then returned it, dry, to the same (or a different) spot once they got wind of rescue efforts for the owner of the backpack and realized it might implicate them in more than just “finders, keepers.”\n\nAs for the photos in the camera, how would taking dozens of photos of the sky at night serve to mislead police? And the height-distorted photo of Lisanne? Digital photos occasionally are goofy like that (I have a rear-view pic of my motorcycle where the panniers look like two different sizes). The clouds at the trail overlook completely mismatching in photos taken seconds apart? Weird, but how does that suggest foul play, when the girls are posing normally? The deleted photo? A tech-savvy killer would only take the batteries out of the phones and throw everything in the river or bury it all, making deleting photos unnecessary and also increasing the mystery to the killer’s advantage. Anyways, why disguise a murder as an accident, when both possibilities (murder or losing their way) are going to be speculated about regardless? I can certainly see the girls using the camera flashes to attempt signalling toward airplane sounds and checking for hazards in their path (note the one photo of a dangerous drop down a rock). Furthermore, why would a killer force-march two victims miles through a jungle, only to kill them in the middle of nowhere? That makes no sense - killers aren't lazy, but what advantage would there be to the killer?. \n\nI think these girls just got hopelessly lost, and that leads me back to my own experiences of being lost in the woods - the more you try to guess your way out in a panicked and confused state of mind, the more lost you get. To me, the most important thing about this tragedy isn't how the girls died, but the decisions they made leading up to their disappearance. They'd worked hard as waitresses in the Netherlands to save for the trip and they were young, idealistic and eager, so it's understandable they'd be adventurous. But they'd already reached their goal of living in that small tropical town in Panama and they hadn't even seriously explored the town itself yet. They had a guided hike scheduled for the next day. What was the hurry to get into the jungle? Going to extremes is always a dangerous thing, and getting too adventurous too soon was going to an extreme. I think the girls were their own killers.",

        "text": "It is interesting how Kris was unsmiling and looked uneasy in her last photo at the river. Given the mood of their previous photos, they should both have been ideally standing on those rocks together smiling and taking photos together. The fact that this particular photo shows Kris alone at a distance on the river looking back with an uneasy expression on her face is a cause for concern. Even if she had instructed Lisanne to take a solo photo of her, she should have at least been smiling and posing because she was comfortable in her friend's company. This leads me to believe that they had already encountered their assailant(s) at this time. Perhaps it was the assailant behind the camera taking a photo of Kris for whatever reason hence her worried expression. The argument that they got lost holds no water simply because of the state some of their remains were found in and the detective is right, they would have left at least a message or something narrating what went wrong. Their bodies would also have been found intact because they would probably have died of starvation if they got lost in the jungle. The night photos are the biggest puzzle in my opinion. It makes no sense at all that they would suddenly decide to use the camera as a flash to illuminate the way after all those days. Even if that is the case, it doesn't explain the photos of the sky or kris' hair with hints of blood on it. I actually thought that that photo could have been Kris herself holding the camera behind her head to try and take a picture of the wound in order to assess the damage. If that is true, then it means that she must have been alone at this point and was probably taking pictures of the sky as a way to try and signal her position to Lisanne or potential search teams whom she would probably have expected to be on the lookout for them. The photos of the surrounding could then imply that something or someone was lurking nearby and she was trying desperately to see who/what it was. Based on the evidence, i know for a fact that it was murder. The only questions that remain unanswered are who did it, how they did it, why they did it and the location of the rest of the remains.",

A-t-il voulu surveiller les recherches pour couvrir des personnes connues ? Son fils ?\nLe sac à dos réapparu, intact, pas possible qu'il soit resté dehors tout ce temps. L'enquête avançant, les ravisseurs/assassins l'ont sorti pour laisser croire à un accident. La carte est laissée dans l'appareil photo pour \"montrer\" que personne n'y avait touché à part les filles. Mais la photo soigneusement effacée : sûrement pour ne pas trahir une ou des personnes prises en photo par une des filles. Les autres photos \"étranges\" : peut-être prises en douce par une des filles qui aura été transportée ou tirée dans cette jungle quelques jours après par des ravisseurs/violeurs avant le pire ? Comme elles ne montraient personne, elles n'ont pas été effacées. Les téléphones avaient peut-être été confisqués ? Plein de traces d'ADN, pourquoi pas de recherches ? \nEnquête vite close avec conclusion de disparition accidentelle : corruption policière, juridique  pour protéger des locaux connus, ou bien en effet pour préserver la manne du tourisme ?\nLe corps (débris) ayant eu de la chaux vive, preuve d'assassinat, tentative de destruction...\nPauvres familles quand elles ont su...\nMerci Lionel pour la mémoire de ces deux jeunes filles.\nElles ont tout de même fait preuve de naïveté et d'imprudence, quel gâchis !\n\nEdit : le sac à dos ne présente pas de traces de violence.

Le guide (il a une maison plus ou moins dans le secteur, et un fils dont on ne sait rien) ? Puis attirées dans un traquenard d'abord à leur insu, d'abord \"gentiment accueillies\", puis séquestrées  et violentées, mais loin du fameux mirador ? Les a-t-on forcées à marcher jusqu'à ce lieu ? Ont-elles été droguées à un moment ? \nLes photos mal prises ont peut-être été faites par l'une des deux filles qui aurait tenté de fuir un ou plusieurs jours après ?

It was probably so dark, that Lisanne just did not realize Kris was standing before the lens or she accidentally pressed the shutter button while holding the camera down for a moment. Maybe the camera was overheating and she wanted to check why it would not take another photo when she was pressing the shutter button and then she realized it was working again when she accidentally took the hair photo.",

I strongly believe the girls encountered a missing child and possibly tried to comfort them by showing the child how to use the camera. It seems the child took the final photos of the women, indicated by the quality and distance, differing from the girls' usual selfies. This aligns with the possibility of the girls deleting a poor-quality photo the child took, or perhaps a more unsettling scenario where a photo of the child with the two women was deleted, potentially by authorities for unknown reasons.\n\nSeveral pieces of evidence support the theory of the girls encountering a child:\n\n1. Their direction indicated they were attempting to assist the child by heading north, likely trying to help the child return home.\n2. A photo of Kris displaying a playful gesture suggests she was trying to make the child feel at ease while he is photographing her.\n3. The photos only feature Kris, implying Lisanne might have been engaging with the child while photos were taken.\n4. Subsequent photos bear resemblance to those typically taken by a child.\n\nI believe the child might have been used as a lure, leading to the tragic end of the two women upon reaching the child's family or someone else. The child might have been rewarded with the women's belongings or simply retained them, including the camera and phones.\n\nThe child seemed to have limited knowledge about using the camera, likely taught by the two women. However, the child struggled with using the phones, inadvertently triggering emergency calls and entering incorrect PINs. Fascinated by the camera's functionality, the child randomly took photos, including one of Kris' deceased head. Subsequently, someone disposed of the bag, potentially an essential piece of evidence. Later, a villager discovered the bag and initially chose to keep it. However, upon learning of a potential reward, they opted to hand it to the authorities, considering the reward more valuable than the bag's contents.",

        "text": "They reached the summit an hour ahead of what they had planned and decided to go looking for waterfalls, though they had been advised not to. (They both had extensive search histories concerning the location of said waterfalls in the week leading up to their disappearance, but assured those who warned them not to look for them that they wouldn't... but they did end up with around two extra hours they weren't expecting to have by reaching the summit early...) The gullies they photographed themselves in were not all along their original path and have since been identified. As has the dirt trail they were on a week later. What most likely happened was that they realized they weren't going to be able ro make it back to the summit (and thus the only path back to town) before it got dark  and were going to have to spend the night on the mountain. In that gully area, the only cleared ground suitable for setting up any sort of makeshift camp would be one of the gullies themselves. They made their first attempts to contact help around an hour before dark which makes sense. The temperature was in the mid to upper 50's at night, and they were in shorts and tee shirts, so they would have wanted shelter. The debris formations they took pictures of themselves in front of would have seemed ideal for that. Such gullies are dangerous (especially before the rainy season is fully under way) since blockages can form and hold back water, leading to a very strong surge with debris down the mountain when the blockage gives. It likely rained that night, and they got hit by such a surge with nowhere to go inside the debris tunnel they were in. I've seen such surges, and they would definitely have been injured to some degree and washed along for a bit. Had one or both been carried to where the incline steepened, it would have led to significant injuries and no viable way back up.\n\nThey would have had to travel down the gully, which would have taken them to the river. There, they would have had water, but nowhere to really go (especially if one or more were injured) and would likely have decided to wait and hope a boat would go by (highly unlikely), or searchers would find them. You can go quite a while without food, but after about a week, you'd be pretty desperate. The dirt path they were on in their week later photos has since been identified via drone, and when you see it, things start to make sense. It ran along a gully and from the bottom likely looked like it went all the way up. It didn't. About halfway up, it essentially ran into a wall of dense foliage with nowhere to go. That would have been the last of their energy and the point at which at least one was likely to more or less give up. They probably went back down the mountain to their water source to wait for help, one died, and the other was too weak to make it for much longer. The only way back up would have been a gully, and by then, there was likely a good bit of water flowing down, so the survivor would have had no options. Nature took care of things from there.\n\nThe concerned looks on their faces in some of the gully photos were likely the result of their realizing they weren't going to get back in time but might as well take the pictures since that's what got them into the mess in the first place. While the night photos were likely just them using the flash as a flashlight. The head photo makes sense if you have an injured half starved person going up an incline with the person behind them taking periodic pictures to see where they were going. A stumble and fall would bring the person behind down as well, and a photo could easily have been snapped in the process. The photos aimed upwards were probably an attempt to signal a drug plane heard but not seen (as they run without lights) which regularly fly over that area at night. (Somewhere down there, there's probably such a pilot who saw those flashes but can't say anything about it because then they would have to explain why they were flying over that area at night with no flight plan registered anywhere.)\n\nThe physical evidence all makes sense as remains and items will get washed into the river during the rainy season. Also, the people in the village were not informed of the missing hikers until quite a while afterward and their stories as to where the evidence was found and it's initial condition were different depending on which villager was asked. They had probably already found the stuff, cleaned it, and were using some of it when they found out, and just threw it all back together to turn it in. The phones and camera were damaged and not in working condition with quite a bit of garbled data on them. The investigators were simply able to retrieve some of the data from them. The oddities of missing photos etc. could easily be explained by that. The \"famous\" missing photo had a registry entry but no trace of the actual image file. That can happen from a glitch. The investigators merely said that the only way it could have manually been removed was via PC, not that it had been removed so. Anyone smart enough to remove the image file would have purged the registry entry as well and attempted to adjust the numbering to completely cover it... or just destroyed the camera (and phones) to make sure there was no evidence to begin with. The foot in the shoe is perfectly natural when it comes to human remains. Shoes slow the decomp process down which leads to the feet eventually falling off. Shoes are somewhat buoyant, so if they end up in the water, they'll travel along. The \"sun bleached\" bones were most likely not truly or fully sun bleached. A couple of species of the last stage decomp beetles in the area excrete phosphates as they do their work. Such phosphates easily and quickly leech into the bone and turn it very white (they even have a slight glow in the dark for a bit after prolonged exposure to sunlight.)\n\nI think that covers most of the \"mystery.\"",

Tech isnt 100%, so I'm not surprised at all by a weird glitch and a missing photo. I also think she thought she heard something and started using the flash as a way to try to get attention. Either that or her friend was on the brink of death and got really desperate to maybe try to catch someone's attention with the flash, hoping a rescuer in the area will see it.",

        "text": "If these girls were lost and died as a result of injuries why were only 10% and 5% of their remains found? Why were their remains \"widely scattered,\" broken up and bleached? Medical examiners reported the bones were found clean, with no bite marks or scratches that would indicate that a predator or scavenger attacked at any point. Photographic evidence from the phone reportedly showed Kris laying down with blood on her temple. Why are larger bones and more remains not being found grouped together? It's not natural for the rapid fragmentation of bones over a short period of time. \n\nThe killer(s) could have taken pictures of the murder site so that they could return to it later. Of all the things Lisanne would do why would she take a closeup photo of her injured or deceased friend in the middle of the night? Especially 2 days after she was injured or deceased. (The failed PIN attempts indicate someone wasn't able to get into Kris's phone after April 6. The photos were taken April 8th.) That is incredibly bizarre. Lisanne was apparently alive several days after Kris, why would she not leave any other type of message with her camera or phone? Why would she only take photos very late into the night if she was alive for days after?\n\nAlso why were the girls carrying a large mirror while hiking? Most young people use phones to look at themselves.\n\nOne more point. Kris's phone was used to take the night photos after there were already multiple failed attempts to put the PIN into the phone. There was also a single deleted photo numbered 509 which was taken in-between the daytime photos and the night photos. Is it even possible to delete a photo when there is a PIN code lock on the phone?",

        "text": "I'm sceptical of the murder theories, although they're understandable, given past crimes involving young women hikers in foreign countries. I have myself been seriously lost in the woods twice, and once guided out a young woman lost in the woods at night while I was camping just off the Appalachian trail. Each time it was dramatic how fast disorientation and panic set in - it's the panic-fear that makes one automatically do the opposite of what one should do. It's not like your car's GPS stops working on a road trip. It's more like falling off a cruise ship and watching it disappear over the horizon. I can only infer that in the most serious cases, especially after days of food deprivation and chronic anxiety and stress, disorientation could become so severe that the two inexperienced girls in the Panama case would begin acting almost pathologically confused, while desperate hope may have led them to forego goodbye messages for the sake of attempts to reach local rescue until the batteries in their phones went dead and it was too late.\n\nI've watched a couple of the better pieced-together videos and I found myself getting sceptical of the murder theories when I saw too much bias in that direction. For example, some of the \"happy\" photos early on in their hike were slightly distorted or the clouds seemed mis-timed from one snap to the next or the one girl was supposedly a little depressed or anxious looking, and to me all that seemed overly subjective and irrelevant to any criminal activity. The idea of any killers allowing their victims to keep taking photos is ridiculous, not just because it creates possible evidence but because abduction and murder (rape also) is about having complete power and control over someone.\n\nWhy would a killer and not the girls turn the phones on and off? Only the girls had any reason to do that repeatedly, and if they had the chance to do so around an abductor, they also would have had the chance to escape. The backpack could have been misplaced by the girls in their disoriented state until a villager found and took it, then returned it, dry, to the same (or a different) spot once they got wind of rescue efforts for the owner of the backpack and realized it might implicate them in more than just “finders, keepers.”\n\nAs for the photos in the camera, how would taking dozens of photos of the sky at night serve to mislead police? And the height-distorted photo of Lisanne? Digital photos occasionally are goofy like that (I have a rear-view pic of my motorcycle where the panniers look like two different sizes). The clouds at the trail overlook completely mismatching in photos taken seconds apart? Weird, but how does that suggest foul play, when the girls are posing normally? The deleted photo? A tech-savvy killer would only take the batteries out of the phones and throw everything in the river or bury it all, making deleting photos unnecessary and also increasing the mystery to the killer’s advantage. Anyways, why disguise a murder as an accident, when both possibilities (murder or losing their way) are going to be speculated about regardless? I can certainly see the girls using the camera flashes to attempt signalling toward airplane sounds and checking for hazards in their path (note the one photo of a dangerous drop down a rock). Furthermore, why would a killer force-march two victims miles through a jungle, only to kill them in the middle of nowhere? That makes no sense - killers aren't lazy, but what advantage would there be to the killer? \n\nI think these girls just got hopelessly lost, and that leads me back to my own experiences of being lost in the woods - the more you try to guess your way out in a panicked and confused state of mind, the more lost you get. To me, the most important thing about this tragedy isn't how the girls died, but the decisions they made leading up to their disappearance. They'd worked hard as waitresses in the Netherlands to save for the trip and they were young, idealistic and eager, so it's understandable they'd be adventurous. But they'd already reached their goal of living in that small tropical town in Panama and they hadn't even seriously explored the town itself yet. They had a guided hike scheduled for the next day. What was the hurry to get into the jungle? Going to extremes is always a dangerous thing, and getting too adventurous too soon was going to an extreme. I think the girls were their own killers.",

Pour la théorie de la photo supprimée, je ne crois pas à la suppression de la photo par la police. Si jamais elles étaient dans la jungle, seule dans le noir et qu'elles tentaient d'interpeller un hélicoptère et qu'on voyait cet hélicoptère sur la photo, d'où la raison de sa suppression, je pense justement qu'elles auraient \"bombardé\" les photos pour les interpeller encore plus et donc de ce fait il n'y aurait pas eu une seule photo supprimée mais plusieurs. Pour moi les photos étranges dans la jungle le soir servaient juste d'éclairage pour qu'elles puissent marcher et les photos vers le ciel je pense étaient vraiment faites pour appeler à l'aide, sans succès. La photo de la chevelure de Kris est bizarre mais je ne vois ni bouche (comme tu le dis les cheveux ont l'air de venir par le droit donc bizarre cet emplacement de sois-disant bouche et nez), ni sang. Honnêtement je pense à un simple accident, les os confirment une chute de très haut, le fait que les os de Kris soit complètement nettoyé ça c'est bizarre mais comme tu l'as dit peut être que ça vient de l'ensoleillement intensif qu'ils ont pu subir, je ne sais pas. Que ce soit criminel ou accidentel, elles n'ont pas eu de chance et elles étaient là au mauvais endroit, au mauvais moment.",

        "text": "I think their Diaries are a huge clue. 2 girls who wrote in their diaries every day would have definitely left a message if they're trying to call for Emergency every day starting April 1st. When Lisanne skipped a few days, her next entry she provided all 3 dates and said \"Of course I'll fill you in.\" That was just a few days before she went missing. Of course they would leave a message. \nThe Emergency calls could have easily been placed by the abductors handling their phone. Told to call it around the same time everyday and they didn't worry because they know there is no reception there. 1 of the calls makes a signal for 2 seconds, so what do they do next? They turn the phone off 36 seconds later. Now why would they turn the phone off now that they finally made a connection? Maybe they feared they would be traced.\nAlso the night photos are very creepy because that photo of Kris' hair seems to be on purpose. Why only 1 photo of hair, and why Kris' hair? Because we know it's Kris' hair and we don't question it. If it was Lisanne's hair we would assume it's her but so many people have brown hair that maybe it wouldn't be. They took a photo of Kris' hair to confirm it's the 2 missing girls, and imo the rest of the photos is a tease to investigators basically saying \"You'll never find them, and you won't find this spot. Not in this big jungle.\".\nThe photo of the red hair is in focus, it's not blurry. Which means they took their time taking that photo. Every strand of hair is in focus so they definitely were not moving. We only see her hair and nothing else. Also for being in the jungle for a week, that is the cleanest hair. No dirt, no grass, no leaves, her hair doesn't even appear wet. Yet we are supposed to believe Panama saying it's an accident and they fell off a monkey bridge into a river? That's not even possible when you look at the photos taken in a dry location. The orbs are probably from the mist from a river nearby, but they aren't in the river.\nWe've got a suspect that could be investigated but nobody bothered. I'm talking about the tour guide who is suspicious in every single way. Let me ask you something, how would you feel if your tour guide showed up at your house if you skipped a tour with him? Wouldn't you be creeped out? What if you skip an appointment at the barber shop, do you think it's normal for a barber to show up at your house, drop everything he's doing to come look for you? \nHe's a tour guide, he's not that important. If you skip a tour with him it's not a big deal. He runs a coffee farm too, meaning he dropped everything and ran around town looking for 2 girls? Seems odd to me. He even entered the home they were staying at on April 2nd and stayed for about a half an hour. He literally went into their house. Maybe they had a hangover or slept-in did he ever think of that? Or did he worry that they spoke to others about meeting him so he wanted to protect himself by appearing concerned? Since he's the only proof we have of the April 2nd meeting at 8am. It's all according to him.\nAlso with a mystery this big, isn't it odd that it also has 1 of the biggest coincidences? Or maybe because it's not a coincidence. I mean how the tour guide who was supposed to meet these 2 girls, also finds their foot. I mean what a coincidence. Even the reporter he talked to about it felt the same way. He talks about finding the foot behind the tree, and the reporter's 1st response is \"So it was invisible?\" because how do you just so happen to spot a shoe behind a tree in dense jungle full of foliage. His response was \"No well if we didn't happen to look behind that tree at that exact moment walking down the path, we never would have seen it.\" WOW well wasn't that convenient.\nAlso they conveniently find the backpack after the reward money was raised to $30,000??? There are way too many coincidences in this 1 mystery to be considered just a coincidence. That tour guide knows a lot more I believe. Even if he didn't harm the girls himself, I think he knows exactly what happened to them.\nThen the tour guide gives Kris Kremers' parents their own tour to retrace their steps. The mom points to a path and the tour guide is like \"NO, NO!\" not there, anywhere but there. Here let me lead you down the path I choose, far away from any evidence. Then at the end of the tour, he casually takes out his camera, and snaps a photo of the grieving parents with the flash on, in  broad daylight. To be honest, when I saw that flash, I got an image of Kris' red hair from the night photo, with the flash on in focus.",

Because only kris’ shorts were found, now the river is close to the forest, lisanne maybe refused but kris didn’t, maybe it was to take photos and send it to her bf nor post it on social media? we don’t know, then when they got to the forest, only kris’ photos were found, that’s why she wanted to go there. To take photos then instead of going back they continued to walk further and further deep into the forest, and got lost even more so eventually it would be night right? in a few days lisannes phone died, and there was no use of calling 911 bc there wasn’t any signal in the forest, so they made an S.O.S sign out of the map they ripped (shows in one of the photos) now, you see the weird photos “they” took at night? yeah, weird photos, there was one photo of a tree from below, yk? like someone laying below a tree and taking a picture? And they proceed to take really creepy and weird photos, there was a photo of kris’ hair from behind right? That could maybe have been taken by lisanne, bc there was IMG #509 that was deleted, so if your thinking like : “There could’ve been a kidnapper from behind” I don’t believe it. so when they were just giving up, they had no food and they were starving. There could’ve been a kidnapper and attacked kris, so yk the phone replays? there was “someone” or “something” trying to open kris’ phone but didn’t know the PIN so the phone was officially shutted down and i think lisanne was trying to open kris’ phone, and tried to run away but the kidnapper cut lisannes foot, yk that picture of her foot rotting? that’s a clean slice so it couldn’t be an animal or any type of accident, it could have been a human being right? and lisanne has a camera, kris also has a camera. but lisannes camera was in her pocket and accidentally took a pic of the kidnapper so that’s why IMG #509 is deleted, the kidnapper deleted the photo so the police wouldn’t find out. and there’s one little teori i believe, in Panama there are a lot of ethnic groups and in some, they use humans to be their “sacrifice” or smth, but they only use perfect humans. Kris was attacked so she obviously had wounds right? and lisannes foot was cut off, inside lisannes shoe is her rotten foot that even has bones. so maybe the people fed their bodies to hyenas or any wild animals, that’s why bones were found in the location where kris’ shorts were found, so yeah.",

        "text": "I’m gonna say it. THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT. There was a third party involved, no question about it. Let me explain my view of this.\n1. The girls bag contained neatly folded clothing, and everything seemed recently organized. The backpack was found neatly placed on a rock by a stream, out in the open, almost like it was put there intentionally. One  of the girls shorts were also found neatly folded as well. In their supposed situation, I highly doubt you would care about folding things and making them perfect.\n\n2. The cameras’ night photos used flash. People assumed they were trying to light their way, but a camera flash is blinding in itself. Surely they couldn’t have seen at all. Your eyes have to adjust when introduced to light, and in the short span of a flash, there isn’t time for that, thus you are blinded anyway. \n\n3. There is a photo of the back of kris’s head, with what appears to be blood. If kris was in such shape, I doubt she would still be trekking on. They were thirsty, and weak. With injuries added to that, and they were dressed in skimpy shorts and tank tops, I doubt they kept going strong. If another person was involved, I think that because perhaps the girls were already dead, they took a picture of the back of kris’s head as not to raise suspicion that the girls weren’t the ones taking the photos. At first glance, it seems lizzane took the image of kris because it’s understood that they were together at the time. However, we never see anything of lizzane after the daytime pictures. The person assumed that because kris was “injured” she wouldn’t be taking the pictures, so the person decided against showing lizzane in any images.\n \n4. There is a deleted image in the camera. In the girls situation, why would they worry about deleting images? Also, the missing image is the gap between the last daytime photo, and first night photo. This missing image may have captured something that the third party did not want police to see. It’s too suspicious.\n\n5. Their skeletons were found, scattered and sun- bleached only 35 days after the last phone use? No. It takes at least a month for their skeletons to reach the state in which they were found. The girls have been dead longer. They probably died the first day, and the phones were used by the third party. Science can back this up, they didn’t survive in the jungle injured, hungry, and without water for 10 days. That just doesn’t happen.",

        "text": "Good detective work dude. I think you are onto something here. This also explains why the mood of the two girls changes in their photographs. There is a 3rd person present in the photos, unseen, behind or off-camera, a person whose presence is clearly affecting their mood. They know that they have no power in this situation, but it is not dire yet, so Kris's facial expression switches from happy to neutral, as they try to manage the situation as best as they can, trying to get rid of this 3rd person or placate them, even while they fear for their lives. They are not photographing themselves together in the photos any more because the 3rd person is with them, probably behind Lisanne's camera point of view, allowing them to use their phone but not appearing in the photos. This also explains why one photo was deleted.\n\nI think the truth will come out that there was foul play though - there is no doubt about that: this was not a difficult trek, and why else would they continue north? Whether it was this person that you mention - and the negative review is very telling - or someone else linked to them, even the silence of the locals will tell a story.",

Nobody seems to know exactly when that photo was taken, and the girls didn't mention the swimming excursion in their diaries. There was a rumor that the photo was taken on April 1st -- that they DID come back from their hike, went swimming, and then met with foul play, which would explain some of the things found in the backpack. But it doesn't explain the night photos and emergency calls. In other words, I'm as puzzled by the case as I was when I started looking into it about a month and a half ago. \nIt seems like whenever you settle on a possible theory as to what happened, there are a bunch of other facts that contradict it.",

        "text": "Dude, my boyfriend and I LOVE this channel, but we have unanimously come to the conclusion that this is hocus pocus. Almost all of the \"unusual\" and \"unexplainable\" mysteries surrounding this case can reasonably be explained away by common happenings in missing hiker situations. For one thing, the friend that looks \"worried\" in some of the later photos, doesn't really look all that worried to me? Assuming for argument's sake that she is boasting a less-than-happy expression, that is likely because the photos are candid (which they definitely appear to be) and I don't know many people that can naturally flash an extravagant smile, such as those shown in the earlier posed photos, while being candidly photo'd. Not only this, but she's likely a lot more worn down at this point in the hike. Secondly, while it's true that emergency calls can be made without unlocking a smartphone, once a person is dehydrated they are really very disoriented and it would not be surprising if they had forgotten this knowledge, assuming the phone did have that capability and they were aware of that capability in the first place (I was pretty ditzy at 21...). Not only would they have been dehydrated, but it would seem that the owner of the phone had either perished or was close to it, which would definitely panic the living friend--making it even more likely that they would behave erratically and not be in the right mindset to 1. Remember the pin code (if their dying/dead friend had given it to them before) 2. Recall that emergency phone services are available without unlocking the phone. Also, we have no idea what the person trying to unlock phone was actually trying to achieve--maybe it was something that did require the phone to be unlocked. There's really no telling what a severely dehydrated and panicked lost hiker is thinking. The photos in the dark are definitely either one of the girls flashing for help or lighting their way in the dark. Photos from a digital camera should be retrievable even if they were deleted from the camera, so idk why investigators didn't try to retrieve them if there are deleted photos as was stated. Maybe the photos were one girl taking a photo of their deceased friend for documentation, but were then deleted because the girl changed her mind about having such a gruesome thing documented? Serious speculation on my part there, but it really could have been anything that was deleted. As for the remains potentially indicating foul play... it would be very very VERY strange for a \"killer\" to hold the girls hostage until they literally died from natural causes. Like, all evidence points to them dying slowly, making multiple concerted attempts over a lengthy span of time to contact help to no avail. I have no idea what the motive would be for a kidnapper or murderer to just tag along with the girls until they died. Their remains showing little to no decomposition could very well be evidence of scavenging animals picking the corpses clean. Given the sheer biodiversity of Panama, there are likely many animals around to take care of that job. Of course, the forensics would have to show signs of this, so if they don't then 🤷‍♀️ also any footprints left by animals would have been washed away after 70 days, though it is possible their remains washed into the river during a high water event and were carried downstream from the actual place of death anyway. Of course locals are going to say it's hard to get lost in that forest... they're locals! Not only that, but hikers go missing ALL THE TIME on well-marked and well-traveled trails. A fall or injury would exacerbate getting lost. I agree that some things are strange, like the clean cut to the leg if that is accurate. And the rolled up skin... though that one perplexes me as, surely investigators would have taken that to a lab for DNA testing? If another person rolled that skin up (or monkey or whatever) there would probably be some DNA trail. 70 days in a rainforest may have eliminated such data, though. The pristine backpack is pretty strange, but I'm betting the condition of the backpack is maybe exaggerated a little... bht still 🤷‍♀️ The best explanation is the most likely one. I get making stories out to have dramatic or creepy spins for content, but this just sounds like a really sad story of two friends getting lost in the Rainforest and dying with some odd twists thrown in the middle ☹",

        "text": "They reached the summit an hour ahead of what they had planned and decided to go looking for waterfalls, though they had been advised not to. (They both had extensive search histories concerning the location of said waterfalls in the week leading up to their disappearance, but assured those who warned them not to look for them that they wouldn't... but they did end up with around two extra hours they weren't expecting to have by reaching the summit early...) The gullies they photographed themselves in were not all along their original path and have since been identified. As has the dirt trail they were on a week later. What most likely happened was that they realized they weren't going to be able ro make it back to the summit (and thus the only path back to town) before it got dark  and were going to have to spend the night on the mountain. In that gully area, the only cleared ground suitable for setting up any sort of makeshift camp would be one of the gullies themselves. They made their first attempts to contact help around an hour before dark which makes sense. The temperature was in the mid to upper 50's at night, and they were in shorts and tee shirts, so they would have wanted shelter. The debris formations they took pictures of themselves in front of would have seemed ideal for that. Such gullies are dangerous (especially before the rainy season is fully under way) since blockages can form and hold back water, leading to a very strong surge with debris down the mountain when the blockage gives. It likely rained that night, and they got hit by such a surge with nowhere to go inside the debris tunnel they were in. I've seen such surges, and they would definitely have been injured to some degree and washed along for a bit. Had one or both been carried to where the incline steepened, it would have led to significant injuries and no viable way back up.\n\nThey would have had to travel down the gully, which would have taken them to the river. There, they would have had water, but nowhere to really go (especially if one or more were injured) and would likely have decided to wait and hope a boat would go by (highly unlikely), or searchers would find them. You can go quite a while without food, but after about a week, you'd be pretty desperate. The dirt path they were on in their week later photos has since been identified via drone, and when you see it, things start to make sense. It ran along a gully and from the bottom likely looked like it went all the way up. It didn't. About halfway up, it essentially ran into a wall of dense foliage with nowhere to go. That would have been the last of their energy and the point at which at least one was likely to more or less give up. They probably went back down the mountain to their water source to wait for help, one died, and the other was too weak to make it for much longer. The only way back up would have been a gully, and by then, there was likely a good bit of water flowing down, so the survivor would have had no options. Nature took care of things from there.\n\nThe concerned looks on their faces in some of the gully photos were likely the result of their realizing they weren't going to get back in time but might as well take the pictures since that's what got them into the mess in the first place. While the night photos were likely just them using the flash as a flashlight. The head photo makes sense if you have an injured half starved person going up an incline with the person behind them taking periodic pictures to see where they were going. A stumble and fall would bring the person behind down as well, and a photo could easily have been snapped in the process. The photos aimed upwards were probably an attempt to signal a drug plane heard but not seen (as they run without lights) which regularly fly over that area at night. (Somewhere down there, there's probably such a pilot who saw those flashes but can't say anything about it because then they would have to explain why they were flying over that area at night with no flight plan registered anywhere.)\n\nThe physical evidence all makes sense as remains and items will get washed into the river during the rainy season. Also, the people in the village were not informed of the missing hikers until quite a while afterward and their stories as to where the evidence was found and it's initial condition were different depending on which villager was asked. They had probably already found the stuff, cleaned it, and were using some of it when they found out, and just threw it all back together to turn it in. The phones and camera were damaged and not in working condition with quite a bit of garbled data on them. The investigators were simply able to retrieve some of the data from them. The oddities of missing photos etc. could easily be explained by that. The \"famous\" missing photo had a registry entry but no trace of the actual image file. That can happen from a glitch. The investigators merely said that the only way it could have manually been removed was via PC, not that it had been removed so. Anyone smart enough to remove the image file would have purged the registry entry as well and attempted to adjust the numbering to completely cover it... or just destroyed the camera (and phones) to make sure there was no evidence to begin with. The foot in the shoe is perfectly natural when it comes to human remains. Shoes slow the decomp process down which leads to the feet eventually falling off. Shoes are somewhat buoyant, so if they end up in the water, they'll travel along. The \"sun bleached\" bones were most likely not truly or fully sun bleached. A couple of species of the last stage decomp beetles in the area excrete phosphates as they do their work. Such phosphates easily and quickly leech into the bone and turn it very white (they even have a slight glow in the dark for a bit after prolonged exposure to sunlight.)\n\nI think that covers most of the \"mystery.\"",

(i did find the link and tried to post it but it is disappearing.  i won't post again, don't want to get flagged as a spammer, but you will find this photo easily online)  as of right now, i screenshotted it to my phone.\nedit(2):  the photo i'm referring to is at 12:20.  it is very unclear, as to what the look on Kris's face is, in this photo.  please try to find the enhanced photo and zoom in and look at Kris's face. ....   I need to know someone's opinion on what they see !!!!  the original image looks like Kris could be starting to say something, or possibly surprised or even smiling.  but what you see in the enhanced photo is nothing like what it appears to look like in the original photo at 12:20 ish",

        "text": "Il y a un élément TROUBLANT que tu n'as pas cité dans ta vidéo : la prise d'angle totalement inhabituelle des 90 photos suivant leur disparition. En effet, la hauteur, l'angle et le style photographique sont des paramètres propres au photographe, un peu somme sa signature, son écriture. \n\nAutre élément accablant NON MENTIONNÉ : les appels au 112 et 911 sont passés à des intervalles très régulières !!! Entre 10h et 13h, 3 jours d'affilée ! Comme si les appels étaient programmés.. dans ce genre de situation, c'est presque impossible d'appeler à ces horaires aussi réguliers. \n\nN'y avait t-il pas d'empruntes sur l'appareil photo? Les téléphones ? Avoir des gants dans une jungle, ça me paraît un peu trop prévoyant.\n\nDe plus, si de la chaux a été découverte sur un os, les doutes sont levés.\n\nAutre élément prouvant le meurtre est le dépôt du sac en parfait état et sec plus au bord de la rivière, en plus de la photo 509 supprimée délibérément après coup. Le sac aurait été retrouvé en aussi mauvais état que les corps, les corps ont eux été jetés au lieu du sac. \n\nEnfin, les autorités panaméennes ont  délibérément étouffé l'affaire pour ne pas attiser les tensions avec les cartels locaux. A rappeler que le pays est sujet à la corruption, et un intérêt économique incontestable incite les autorités à opter pour la facile option de l'accident. \n\nDernier point : la photo prise des cheveux de la victime a été prise dans le but de prouver quelle était encore vivante \"entière\". \n\nRappellez vous des photos prises par les deux jeunes femmes avant le meurtre : pourquoi aurait elle prit une photo de la tête de son amie?! Et avec un angle aussi rapproché? La raison est évidente : essayer de prouver quelle était en vie, les agresseurs se sont trahis en prenant ces photos à l'angle trop différent, en déposant le sac, en dissolvant les tissus et os à l'aide de putréfacteurs chimiques.\n\nPaix aux âmes de ces deux jeunes femmes qui peuvent garder l'âme haute pour leur esprit humanitaire et leur dévouement. La vie se chargera de ces tueurs, sous hommes, dont le karma rattrapera les âmes.",

The missing photo was the first one taken at night presumably. Using the camera for light, They may have deleted the first “garbage photo” of just the ground at night and then realized deleting them was pointless so they continued to just take more photos without deleting them. Taking a photo of the back of her head was possibly to check for injuries after a fall since there was no light. I think the saddest part is probably that they were very close to a village (since the backpack was discovered there) and didn’t find help in time.",

        "text": "Ive watched a few videos on this case and one other thing I found odd was that there were a few people who had reported seeing the girls leave/make it out of the trail, but for some reason the police didn't follow these leads and wrote them off as mistaken identity. I think there are a lot of things that point to foul play, but Kris's bones being chemically bleached and Lisanne's foot being cut off with a clean cut are the main pieces of evidence that don't line up to the authorities story. Authorities eventually wrote off the crime as the girls being lost and dying of natural causes, specifically claiming that they believed the girls fell off a cliff into a body of water. And that the water carried their remains all over the trail. However, their bones had no scratches, dents, cuts, chips, or any damage that would show their bones being carried. Kris's bones were found to have been missing tendons that would take years to decompose. Her bones were completely clean and bleached. If animals had found their bones and eaten what ever was on them, there would be bite marks or some type of remittance to show this. I always found the pictures taken at night very unsettling because we will never know who took those photos. Specifically the one picture of the back of Kris's hair/head. For someone who was walking around in the jungle for days, her hair looks completely clean and kept. The angle is very odd and either looks like she is lifting her hair up from underneath or that she is laying on the floor. As creepy as it is to say, she may not even be alive in that photo. I feel like those photos have something more behind them. Some have said that they believed they were using the flash to see their way, but this doesn't make sense. Some of the pictures look like they are taken near a cliff,  and some don't make sense.  Why would they be concerned about deleting a photo? Why did Kris continue to enter the pin to her own phone wrong several times? Why did their taxi driver take it upon himself to go to the home they were staying in, stay in their room for 30 minutes unattended, and only let the police know hours after starting his own search for them? Seems he gave himself enough time to cover things up, plant evidence, and hide the true events that took place there. If I was lost in the jungle, id be using the night time to rest. No way in hell would I be wondering around in the dark all night where there are wild animals, cliffs and bodies of water all over the place. Id rather sit under a tree until the sun comes back up and I can see where I'm going. Also, the rolled up piece of Lisanne's skin is odd because your skin is one of the first things to be decomposed. Also, Lisanne's foot was severed clean, but there was no blood anywhere? From what I know about that, if there is no blood splatters, drops or anything it indicates that the crime happened somewhere else and the remains and belonging were dropped off/planted. I think Panama officials failed these girls. I think that they cared more about how 2 potential murders would affect the reputation of Panama as a tourist attraction than they did about actually finding out what happened to them. They knew that saying these girls had been murdered would cause people to not visit and travel there, which is one of Panama's main source of income. All the evidence points to something more sinister, and to me, they only had one suspect that I believe had something to do with there deaths. The taxi driver.",

        "text": "In the disappearance of these two Dutch girls, there are two situations that I don't understand and I believe that need a more careful analysis:\n1-If in the first two calls to the Dutch emergency number, they were already under the control of kidnappers, why didn't the criminals take the phones, the camera and all their belongings?\n\nThis doesn't make any sense! No offenders with murderous or sexual intentions would risk being photographed by their victims, or even risk the girls calling the police or leaving a message recorded on their cell phones for when they are found by the authorities.\n\n2- Why don't you have any attempt to call 911 during the night?\n\nWhat would be the worst moment for two girls from an urban environment, lost in the middle of a tropical jungle?\nDo you agree with me that this worst moment would be to spend the night in the forest?! Exhausted, cold, with animals moving on the ground, animal movement in the dark forest, a plague of insects, rain spray, hunger, thirst and darkness everywhere. This would undoubtedly be the time when they would most try to connect to an emergency number, but they didn't.\n\nTrying to explain these two situations, the best way to harmonize was as follows:\nLisanne and Kris decided on their own, to continue the trail past the viewpoint, when they realized they couldn't make it back before nightfall, or because they really got lost and disoriented, they decided to make the first two calls in the late afternoon of April 1st. . Without success, they must surely have screamed for help. They were certainly answered and rescued by someone who heard them both scream, or someone who somehow passed them on the trail. This would explain why the girls did not attempt to call an emergency number during the night, that is, they felt safe to be accompanied by someone they believed to be trustworthy and well intentioned.\nAfter that, they certainly went with that someone, to some nearby property, where they continued to be deceived by lies that reassured them, but that at dawn and after a night's sleep, they always tried to make another emergency call, until the cell phone battery has discharged.\nIt was at that moment that this someone realized that they were totally incommunicado and certainly decided to attack and take their belongings that were all inside the backpack.\nFrom then on, all the evil that befell the girls began.\n\nIn my opinion, between the moment the last cell phone ran out of charge and the dawn of the 8th, Kris Kremers was killed, so in the photos taken on the 8th, only the hair of a lifeless body of Kris appears, trying to simulate a disappearance, with them lost in the night trying to signal their position in the woods and kris dead in Lisanne's arms (who doesn't appear in the photos) as it's the killer planting false evidence, not Lisanne!\n\nAs the pieces of Lisanne Froon's skin were found in mid-June, in an initial state of decomposition, this shows that Lisanne was killed in early June and was under the control of this someone who killed her, for about 60 days. She was the last to die.\n\nNote 1: Seeing the holes in Kris' Jeans, it shows that her dead body was dragged a short distance, where it was thrown. That is, this may indicate that the place where Kris and Lisanne were killed and the bodies were subjected to a chemical treatment for dismemberment and then concealment, are very close to each other, and may be in the vicinity of this property where they felt \"safe\" .\n\nNote 2: Kris' boot found, was it clean and without any remains inside? No animal in the forest, would be interested in carrying a leather boot in her mouth! It's not food! That's how the animals would see this boot, any object, they would have smelled it and gone. That boot was taken to the forest by the killer.\n\nNote 3: The police know of more evidence, maybe even the photo that was deleted. At the very least, they want to make some strategic use.\n\nConclusion: Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon, were held captive in an environment they thought was safe, were killed, stripped naked, with the bodies being dismembered by some chemical process as yet unknown. Some dismembered parts, along with the girls' boots, clothes and backpack with all the girls' belongings, were deliberately abandoned along the straight-line trail to create false leads and simulate that the girls died of hunger and thirst after getting lost in the deep in the forest.\n\nThe death of these innocent girls touched me a lot! This is my small contribution to unravel their deaths and thus lead to a punishment, the possible murderer and the possible collaborators.\n\nFortaleza-CE, Brazil.\n\nI very much hope that Jesus Christ will comfort Kris and Lisanne's parents.",

A constant bright photo could also be used to look at things up close or possibly wave in the darkness for help (maybe in tandem with the flash) and might not use as much of the camera's battery, depending on if that was even an issue.\nTruly mysterious..!

        "text": "I actually have previously watched a documentary about this case but decided to watch MrBallen's video just to see how he told the story. There are a few pieces of information I want to add from what I remember from the documentary. \n\nI remember from the documentary that they had mentioned that the area they wanted to hike in was very dangerous, not just the conditions of the hike but the possibility of other people being inside the dense vegetation. There apparently had been other murders not far from where they were hiking that were \"unrelated\". The theory with the photos being taken in the dark was done so the girls could see where they were going, they were using the light from the flash to see where to go which is why the photos seem very strange because they weren't actually taking photos, just using the light (OR their murderer took the photos to confuse investigators). \n\nAnother part of the story is the failed attempts to log in to the phone. It was theorized that the girl who owned the phone fell down into a ravine and the other girl was trying to get into her phone to call for help but didn't know her passcode, and that's why there were so many failed attempts. OR their murderer tried to throw off investigators by making it appear that they were still alive after they had been taken or murdered. \n\nTheir remains were also extremely strange and suspicious. The only parts of Kris that were found were part of her pelvic bone and one of her rib bones with no flesh attached, completely clean and bleached. Traces of phosphorous were found in the bones, which when samples were taken of the area the bones were found, no traces of phosphorus were found, meaning they were intentionally chemically cleaned with phosphorous. Also, in addition to there being no blood found (the water would have washed away some blood but bone marrow is the longest surviving tissue and the last to decompose), the bones were found on the shore, and since bones are denser than water, they would have surely sunk and gotten caught in some rocks in the \"snake-like\" river they were found on the bank of. Instead, they were placed in the same general area as the other remains (which is very unlikely due to the shape of the river). \n\nFor Lisanne, they found a chunk of flesh that still had larvae in it, and appeared to be in the \"second stage\" of decomposition, which is radically different from the state in which Kris's bones were. Also from Lisanne, they found her femur, shin bone, and left foot (which was still inside her hiking shoe), all with flesh attached and bone marrow inside. The cuts were clean and not jagged like you would expect if it was an animal or an accident. I'm not an expert, this is just what I remember plus some quick googling to make sure I said the right things. Overall, definitely does not appear to be an accident.",

Pour ma part je pense également qu'elles ont fait une mauvaise rencontre, toutefois je pense qu'elles ne sont pas restés en vie longtemps malheureusement. Il y à eu intervention d'une tiers personne ça c'est évident, la photo ne s'est pas supprimer toute seule et je pense que si Lisanne avait pris ces 90 photos, elle n'aurait pas montré \"que\" les cheveux de son amie, même se sachant condamnée et dans un ultime effort, elle aurait eu le temps de \"montrer\" plus pour essayer de faire comprendre à ses proches ce qu'il s'est passé. (il est certes facile de dire cela lorsque l'on est tranquillement chez soi au chaud ^^). Ce que je ne comprend pas c'est pourquoi se donner autant de mal pour faire croire à une disparition (en allumant les téléphones, en supprimant la photo et en prenant 90 autres plusieurs jours après, en aidant possiblement les cadavres à se décomposer...), pour ensuite faire en sorte que quelqu'un trouve le sac, ce n'est pas logique, si ce sac n'avait pas été retrouvé, on aurait pensé à un accident et tout le monde aurait fini par oublier.. pourquoi ne pas se débarrasser des téléphones et de l'appareil photo.. cette histoire est très étrange par bien des aspects et tellement de conclusion sont possible, ça doit être terrible pour les familles.",

So photo 509 was corrupted , then the next photo taken was 510. \n(No need to invoke a killer permanently deleting a photo)\n\nKris' pelvis bone DID have rodent damage, it was not \"undamaged\" as was misreported. \nALSO, the \"other\" bones were washed up from a nearby cemetery...\n(No need to invoke a \"killer\" who has killed and dumped the bones of many different victims.)\n***THE ROLLED UP SKIN WAS NOT LISSANE'S (another case of misreporting) \n\nall the calls to 112 mean the girls had the use of their phones and were trying to reach emergency services  (would murderers allow.them to call police?) \n... wouldn't the would-be-murderers just destroy their phones? (and not just delete 1 photo) Why would killers leave ANY evidence which could. potentially lead police to them?\n\n\n\n2. ...I think the girls got hurt and or lost, OR BOTH, and then perished and eaten by scavengers. Their bones could have made their way far downstream/upstream due to flooding or heavy rain and that would explain why they were found so far away from the trail. \nNo foul play needed.\n\n\n3. In one \"night photo\" you can see toilet paper on a rock and there is a small mirror in the middle. \nIt is , i think, an unmistakable sign of an attempt to be found by overhead aircraft\n (the toilet paper is laid out as a message, e.g.  \"SOS\" or something similar , while the mirror, which is  face up, was  placed there in hopes of overhead aircraft seeing a reflection) \n\n\n4. I'm 90% certain there was no foul play, but that is my opinion. \n\nThe Panamanian verdict of a \"hiking accident\" is the only story that makes any sense to me.\n\nPlus , most experts don't see any evidence of foul play. I don't either....",

Lisanne s'est blessée en voulant l'aider, dans la panique elle glisse sur des rochers (fracture au pied, cf : chaussure retrouvé avec un pied en mauvais état à l'intérieur) les deux filles sont donc immobilisées, c'est pour cela qu'elles appellent une seul fois chacune les secours cette journée (vu qu'elles sont immobilisées elles ne peuvent pas se déplacer pour trouver du réseau et cherche à garder un maximum de batterie, 50% de charge en début de rando). Elles devaient passer leurs appels par wifi (pas de forfait téléphonique Panaméen) c'est pour cela qu'elle n'ont jamais essayé de contacter personne d'autre. Lisanne retire le short de Kris pour voir l'ampleur de la blessure (ce qui expliquerait le short retrouvé déboutonné et déchiré à l'arrière et non plié comme beaucoup le dise). Peut être que Kris décède entre ce moment et la journée du 8 ? Lisanne se retrouve seul mais le corps de Kris est à côté d'elle. (c'est pour cela qu'on voit que ses cheveux dans les photos de nuit). Photos qui ont été prisent juste pour flasher d'éventuel secours qui se trouvait proche de leur secteur (hélicoptère si elles sont sur l'autre versant de la montagne) ce qui expliquerait ce grand nombre de photos \"étranges\" prisent pendant presque 3h. Remarque anecdotique : La photo du \"miroir\" ça ressemble plus à un fond de canette. En ce qui concerne la photo (ou vidéo) manquante, elle n'a peut être pas été supprimée, peut être que lors de la chute Lisanne tenait l'appareil et qu'il a prit un coup ce qui à créé une erreur d'écriture ... elle se trouve peut être sur une autre carte SD qui n'a pas été retrouvée. Ex : Peut être que Kriss sentait qu'elle ne s'en sortirait pas et qu'elle a fait une vidéo d'adieu pour ces proches au cas où la carte SD serait retrouvée ... Cette carte serait donc resté avec Kris et Lisanne aurait réinséré la 1ère. Le fait qu'aucune autre photo à été prise entre temps ne me paraît pas étrange. Elles avaient d'autre chose à faire que des photos de vacance dans ce laps de temps. Le sac à sûrement été retrouvé par les gens qui vivent dans le coin, peut-être déposé ici pour la prime ?? (le sac n'était pas en si bon état, il y avait des feuilles et du sable à l'intérieur et des traces d'usure. Rien n'indique nul part que les affaires étaient sèche. Lisanne avait sûrement mis le sac à l'abri, pour protéger le peu d'affaire qu'elles avaient emmenés. C'est pour cela qu'il est encore en a peu près bon état. En ce qui concerne l'état différent des os, Lisanne à pû ramper jusqu'à un endroit plus sûr et plus frais après la mort de son amie et donc son corps s'est décomposé plus lentement. En ce qui concerne l'incapacité des secours à les retrouver, ils cherchaient essentiellement du côté d'el pianista et non sur l'autre versant.",

Another explanation is maybe one of the girls was badly injured and a photo was taken to send if they were to get a signal.  Then, after seeing how gruesome the injury is, she deleted it.  Also possible that she took photo 509 and 510 at the same time, but 509 was nothing, but a blurry photo.  My point is there are a few other options, but the main reason for the case against a third party is the photos after that make me think there wasn't a third party.  If there was a third party, I imagine they would destroy the phones just in case something could have been seen in the photos so you wouldn't be able to get the photos.  Odds are a mix of getting lost in the jungle with one or both being injured is a likely cause.  The incorrect password could be explained by a head injury, lack of sleep causing memory loss, its possible something they ate affected them, but it cannot be ruled out a third party was involved.  I do think the most likely outcome was from a horrible accident mixed with unfamiliar place lead to the sad conclusion of those young women.",

(and not just delete 1 photo) Why would killers leave ANY evidence which could. potentially lead police to them?\n\n\n\n2. ...I think the girls got hurt and or lost, OR BOTH, and then perished and eaten by scavengers. Their bones could have made their way far downstream/upstream due to flooding or heavy rain and that would explain why they were found so far away from the trail. \nNo foul play needed.\n\n\n3. In one \"night photo\" you can see toilet paper on a rock and there is a small mirror in the middle. \nIt is , i think, an unmistakable sign of an attempt to be found by overhead aircraft\n (the toilet paper is laid out as a message, e.g.  \"SOS\" or something similar , while the mirror, which is  face up, was  placed there in hopes of overhead aircraft seeing a reflection) \n\n\n4. I'm 90% certain there was no foul play, but that is my opinion. \n\nThe Panamanian verdict of a \"hiking accident\" is the only story that makes any sense to me.\n\nPlus , most experts don't see any evidence of foul play. I don't either....",

One probably outlasted the other. They didn't die from exposure. The nights were warm (I recall looking at the weather, warm nights and no torrential rains, you can go back and find the old weather reports, even moon cycles AKA enough light to see at night) and there were 2 of them, plenty of water to drink and if you go downhill, which is the path of least resistance, you'll encounter a river, and there's homes along the river.. \n\n\"You last 30 days without food, 3 days without water, 3 minutes without air.\" You know the saying.

They'd have left a message on their phone for their family if they were out there in their final days or taken photos of the injury/bite or memorial for their dead friend etc. \n\nThe killer could easily have taken those photos to make it look as if they just got lost. People get lost and died America all the time, many could have just been picked off by serial killers or pedophiles or traffickers and organ harvesters. They disappear and no one gets caught.

        "text": "Pour la photo 509, il y a une explication plus simple. Le ou les tueurs auraient simplement supprimer la photo de l'appareil directement depuis ce dernier. En effet, tous nos dispositifs de stockage (disques durs, cartes sd, clés usb...) disposent de ce qu'on appelle un système de fichier. Ce dernier dicte comment sont organisées les données sur le dispositif de stockage.\n\nSans rentrer dans les détails, la plupart des systèmes de fichiers ne suppriment pas réellement de la donnée. Quand on supprime un fichier sur ordinateur, on dit juste à Windows de marquer le fichier sur le disque dur comme étant \"supprimé\" ce qui veut dire qu'on pourra ré-écrire dessus. Le fichier semble disparaitre mais il est en réalité toujours là. Il y a bien sûr une façon de lire plus en détail le système de fichier et de remplacer toutes les données du fichier \"supprimé\" par des 0, plutôt que de seulement indiquer qu'on peut réecrire dessus. C'est un processus plus long, et c'est exactement la différence entre un formatage rapide et un formatage total où dans ce cas des 0 sont réellements réecrits partout pour tout effacer.\n\nPour en revenir à cas-ci, il faut s'intéresser au modèle d'appareil photo. Le développeur qui a programmé la fonction de suppression sur ce dernier a très bien pu passer par une fonction de suppression totale (qui réecrit le fichier avec des 0 donc), soit volontairement, soit par méconnaissance : un développeur ne se base que sur des boîtes à outils pré-existantes pour programmer ce qu'il souhaite, il n'est donc pas rare de ne pas totalement tout maîtriser dans les détails pour arriver à programmer ce que l'on souhaite.\n\nEt MÊME si la photo n'était pas totalement supprimée à la suppression via l'appareil, les photos suivantes qui ont été prises ont sûrement fini d'achever ce qu'il restait de la photo 509, puisque la zone de stockage a été marquée comme pouvant être écrasée.\n\nJe ne vois pas pourquoi sinon les tueurs se seraient embêtés à aller supprimer cette photo uniquement via un ordinateur, alors qu'ils auraient pu juste détruire la carte mémoire.",

        "text": "There is absolutely no way that the girls got lost on the Pianista trail.  Photo 509 is the key as it most likely reveals the people responsible for their disappearance, that is obviously why it was erased at a later date with a computer.  The emergency calls after the 1st day and the night time photos are subterfuge.  The emergency calls on the 1st day, April 1, are most likely from the girls, but all after that day are not from them.  For argument's sake, let's say that the girls kept walking past the Mirador on the other side of the continental divide past the small waterfall in photo 508.  If the 1st emergency phone call was at 4:39 PM and the girls reached the Mirador at roughly 1:00 PM, then they would still be walking on the trails for over three hours before the 1st emergency call.  Let's say that they did eventually get lost, then why aren't there any photos of them on the trail after 508? They wouldn't have gotten lost right away, so they would still be walking and enjoying themselves and taking photos.  If you believe in the sequential order of the photos, then they obviously ran into some people right after 508 and 509 is most likely a photo of those people.   They then led them down another path never to be seen again.  If the sequence of the photos was changed, then they most likely returned to the base of the trail and were then intercepted by some guys who convinced them to take a ride with them.  Either way the girls never got lost on the trail.",

If you look very carefully at the sky and the cloud coverage in both photos, you'll see that the clouds were very different. This proves that there was a significant time gap between the two photos being taken which indeed suggests 2 trips to the summit.\n\n2) Now let's compare the photo at 16:52 to the one at 20:35. In the 20:35 photo towards the up and right of Lisanne's head, you'll see a section of the mountain in the background that is shaded. In the 16:52 video, much more of that section is shaded. This proves that in both photos, the sun was in different positions in the sky. This also suggests a significant time gap between the photos and therefore 2 trips to the summit.\n\nThe only part about your theory that I have a problem with is that you say you think they made emergency calls from the car that they were riding in, and then later had a great time drinking and swimming with the guys. That's the only thing that doesn't seem realistic to me.\n\nAnxiously awaiting your part 3. Hope the bad guys (the ones that are still alive at least) get caught and thrown in jail.",

Vous partez du principe qu'il est très facile et systématique de récupérer une photo effacée via des logiciels et que si elle a été effacée, c'est via un ordinateur. Or c'est faux. Il n'y a aucune garantie de récupérer un fichier effacé d'une carte SD, sans pour autant qu'il ait été effacé par ordinateur. Cela s'est vérifié dans d'autres enquêtes. C'est possible mais loin d'être automatique.\n\nRestait-il de la place sur la carte SD? J'ai eu un numérique il a des années de cela et il m'arrivait d'effacer les photos sans intérêt à posteriori pour faire de la place. Or les photos qui nous semblent si étranges (car nous n'avons aucune idée de ce qu'il s'est passé) peuvent avoir eu un intérêt supérieur pour celle qui les a prise (localisation d'un lieu, du corps de sa copine).\n\nOu bien la photo effacée peut l'avoir été totalement par hasard, ça m'est arrivé de multiples fois d'appuyer sur le mauvais bouton en faisant défiler ou en voulant trier mes photos sur ce genre d'appareil. \nEt si les filles ont passé autant de tps ds la jungle et que la thèse de l'accident est la bonne, elles ne devaient plus être en possession de ts leurs moyens, désorientées, affamées, affaiblies physiquement, mentalement, peut-être des hallucinations. Il faut les imaginer vulnérables, perdues ds un milieu inconnu, dangereux avc la nuit, les bruits, les animaux (peut-être une attaque, une morsure, une piqûre) et l'une d'elle a pu se retrouver seule, choquée, démunie si la copine a eu un accident ou n'est pas morte tout de suite et se retrouver ds un état de conscience modifié avec la faim, d'où les photos étranges.\n\nIdem qd vous dites qu'on les aurait forcément retrouvées vu qu'il y a eu des recherches. Je pense que c'est négliger la densité de la jungle dans ces régions, même sur un petit périmètre. \n\nJe n'exclus pas du tout la piste criminelle mais ce n'est pas une évidence selon moi. Chaque élément en faveur de cette thèse est réfutable. En tous les cas, c'était passionnant.",

Disparitions toujours aussi intrigantes et émouvantes en 2022.\nTrès intéressant d'avoir refait une vidéo avec de nouvelles photos et des explications très claires du déroulé des événements.\n\nBeaucoup d'importance est attaché à la disparition de la photos 509. Mais je doute qu'il y ait eu besoin d'un ordinateur pour la supprimer. Je m'explique : il est est possible que la photo ait été supprimée non pas directement après que la photo ait été prise mais tout simplement après que d'autres photos aient été prises par la suite. (Au moment d'un revisionnage des photos prises auparavant par exemple)\n\nDans ce cas l'appareil n'aurait pas pu remplacer automatiquement les numéros de toutes les photos suivantes pour que les numéros se suivent.  D'où la disparition de la photo 509.\n\nEn tout cas c'est deux disparitions sont bien tristes. Je rends hommage à ces deux jeunes filles et j'adresse mes condoléances à leur famille.\n\nVidéo tres bien réalisée. Merci Lionel.\n\nLa disparition de maura murray mériterait bien  elle aussi un update comme celui ci :-)",

I have come across the video where it was claimed the photo Kremers' hair has been digitally tempered with and he actually tried to got it back into its original form, clearly showing that there might have been blood on her head, probably from falling and hitting her head or something. Some even speculate that she has already been dead when the photo was taken. I honestly think they were killed and all the photos and emergency calls were made while they were followed during the night when they were trying to find their way back home, maybe they got lost because they have been chase by someone....when they got killed the person or people went through the phones and found the photo that could incriminate them so they deleted it in a way so that it couldn't be restored.",

So if someone deleted that photo while leaving the ones you shared, they'd have to delete that single photo, full up the memory card and then delete the unnecessary photos while keeps the ones you shared.

        "text": "My beat friend served a 2 year church mission in the remote Panama areas as a service mission doing service for the native people. Church missionaries never carry cash and usually don’t have any at all, they mind their own business and very giving and loving kids 19-26 years old. My best friend after his mission told me all about his 2 years . As a church missionary he was robbed, held at knives point 12 TIMES in 22 months in 5 different areas he served in. He said the thieves knew their routes home and usually waited until they were in a remote stretch of land , then would walk them off the road or trail into the jungle and rob them.  He said half those times the robbers were very agressive and threatened them saying he should kill them so they don’t speak and 2 times they were told , “if you go to the police , nothing will happen except they will tell me you did.” Several indicating the police are on their sides.  They did report every case they felt they were in danger and not once were the police cooperative, never got back to them and absolutely no help. He said Panama was an extremely dangerous place and the church he belongs too about a decade ago pulled ALL their missionaries out of Panama for safety concerns. \nI mention this because a report I saw on this case said the police and locals avidly searched for these girls and it seems to infer the locals wouldn’t hurt 2 beautiful young scantily dressed (according to locals, we see the pictures their in shorts tank tops and swim suits which to locals could be considered that)  the church hd also NEVER allowed female missionaries to go to panama after the early 1990’s becasue of concern for their safety as 21 year old females, I’ve never heard of the church allowing men but not girls so soenthing happened on several occasions to pull all females out for good.  These examples and concerns paint a very dangerous place for foreigners who are often seen as easy targets becasue they’re homes are thousands of miles away.  Sexual assault/rape are common among locals but authorities do nothing so to me it seems obvious these two pretty Caucasian foreigners were noticed by a local and followed or ran into them on the trail. I’d guess SA was involved where the photo of a bloody head of one of the girls was on the camera.  I hadn’t heard they hd a solar charger , the other documentary said they were trying to conserve the phones battery becasue they were lost and it died days after disappearing. A solar charger obviously eliminates a worry about phone dying or the possibility and makes sense that two extremely educated girls traveling the world performing service in a 3rd world country would bring a solar powered battery bank so I buy that.  The clean backpack showing up missing most items indicates someone robbed them or took things after kidnapping or murdering them washing the backpack before placing it in the open where it would be found.  After assaulting them a local would know the jungle wildlife would take care of the bodies if they did already dismember. The shoe and Foote SO far from the trail they were taking tells me they were walked far from that trail knowing people would search the trail. The police according to the parents said they were searching but ended up feeling like they didn’t care and didn’t believe they had searched like stated with investigators rarely returning calls or helping once the parents arrived.  \nIt’s obvious to me with Panamas history of late they were murdered and I feel angry for the parents hearing true crime channels and documentaries pushing that the girls were just young and naive and got lost sucoming to the elements. None of the facts make sense to that suggestion. The phone attempted calls, pictures and the mystery deleted photo deleted AFTER their disappearance, the bloody head, the photos of nothing , a foggy sky wierd angles of jungle which would be someone not familiar with cameras pushing buttons , the girls were extremely smart and independent not stupid. And the media pushing a false idea of the local police and not ever mentioning the insane crime rate, murder rates and rapes in Panama painting it as a safe place for 2 young girls and locals as angels and police as eager to find these girls. Given the facts and recent history it’s quite clear what happened we just don’t know the details. When people push that incorrect narrative it ruins the case becasue parents loose support because false infromation is spread and it demeans the victims and hurts the parents who know their daughters better.  I believe the parents words on the authorities and locals and my best friend and the church over Panamanian police mere words over the phone. If the media had spoke the truth about Panamas dark recent past and the United States governent suggesting Americans don’t travel to panama tells me it’s not safe for 2 pretty young girls . I’m a single dad of 3 amazing daughters that are my life and I’d be asking their travel plans and researching the places their going dissuading any remotely unsafe places for young girls. The FBI suggests young American females travel with adult chaperons when traveling outside the US becasue of human /sex trafficking of foreigners globally from Europe, Asia , Middle East , Taiwan, Phillipines, South America etc. I understand girls wanting to be independent but a dangerous country for locals and especially foreign tourists as a parent put your foot down or at least try to convey with facts the danger. My heart goes out to the parents and Justice will come to those responsible if not in this life , the next.",

        "text": "Now having watched a number of thorough videos on the obvious murders of these two young women I'm going to suggest what others are thinking .  The tour guide who the girls had met previous seems the obvious one to me of having committed this henious crime .  All the evidence points to him , firstly he not only owned  a tour company but also (its stated) a coffee bean plantation , where the girls had visited a few days previous to their disapperence.   Although he had many reasonable reviews online about his character , these where from couples and larger groups , not two girls on their own .  One review is mentioned from a girl travelling on her own who stated in her review \"not to go near him \", he had said some odd things to her including \"he would chop her legs off \" with the machete he always carried  . And in general it was known he had a feddish for northern euro girls.  Next the evidence was spread out to distract the police and others and in one instance 10 miles away , this is to throw them off the trail leading to him .  One off the girls feet was found cleanly cut off , by what , yea you got it.  He'd been trying for days to get into their phones , why , maybe photos of him ?  also one photo was talked off the camera ., the murderer had done this and taken the other night photos , giving the dates etc , trying to make the police believe they were still alive later than they really were, because he could prove his whereabouts no doubt .  The evidence goes on , I would arrest him and maybe the taxi guy , DNA will be somewhere on him or at his den !!!",

No!\" not that path. Definitely not that path, let's continue along this path away from the evidence. \n\nI mean maybe they could have gone down that path? \"NO! NO\" absolutely not, they never would have went that way, make sure you don't look down that path because I don't want you to find any evidence, I mean get hurt. \n\nYeah but one of them had Asthma, and they aren't dumb, they packed light, I just don't see how they could get lost on this trail.\n\nTour guide: Yeah probably got lost! \n\nIt just doesn't seem likely at all\n\nTour guide: definitely got lost\n\nIt's almost like I'm walking with someone who knows way too much but was never investigated.\n\nTour guide: I think they got lost or something.\n\nIt's weird how you also showed up at their residence the day they were supposed to meet you. I mean that's like you missing an appointment at the Barber Shop and the Barber looks all around town for you because he has no other clients or business to run. The barber then appears at your house and stays there for a half hour. \n\nTour guide: I'm thinking they just got lost\n\nIt's also weird how you're able to spot a shoe \"behind a tree trunk\" as you put it. Then when the reporter responds with \"So it was invisible?\" you say \"No we just happened to spot it while walking by on the path\"\n\nTour guide: yeah I have X-Ray vision and can spot stuff \"behind a tree trunk\" because obviously all trees have a front and back. Also I think they probably just got lost.\n\nWell, you certainly don't seem that intimidating with a machete on you at all times, and your buddies with hats and machetes who don't talk much and always look away from the camera are probably very nice as well. Obviously you would only scare a couple girls hiking alone in the Jungle with no reception but obviously if you did something to these girls you would have told us, or investigators.\n\nTour guide: Yeah, probably got lost.\n\n22:55 it did feel a little awkward how you're taking a photo of grieving parents with the flash on in broad daylight. A flash that quickly reminds you of the night photos and the flash used. It's also weird how you're smiling as if you're happy it's the end of the tour and you've led the parents of the victims as far away from the evidence as you can since you know the jungle like the back of your hand. It's probably just a photo of grieving parents to add to your collection of other Grieving Parents of Missing Tourists collection.\n\nTour guide: They got lost and it's time for you 2 to go back to The Netherlands.  Also I'm the Tour Guide and I helped you so you can't consider me a suspect.",

At the time the girls disappeared, they would have known they needed to hustle back as it would take 2 hours to get back. Venturing off the path would be very foolish. \n\n2. If they decided to explore further, we would have seen more photos (?)\n\n3. Why did they write “they” on a piece of the map? Who was “they”? Why did they place it next to the homemade flags?\n\n4. The guide went to their [locked] rooms to check out the situation. Their key was not found in their belongings later on.\n\n5. If they took the wrong trail why in the world would they keep going? Why wouldn’t they sit and wait right where they were?\n\n6. How did the guide “happen” to find their remains?\n\n7. Why was there another set of remains found near theirs? (A mother and an infant I think ). \n\n8.  The guide’s coffee farm was near the remains.\n\n9. Why didn’t they document their ordeal or write a text draft to tell their family about it? People since the beginning of time have left messages to loved ones to let them know what happened when they know their time is about up.\n\n10. Why only dial 911 once on the first day? Wouldn’t you obsessively dial emergency services in a panic on the first day?\n\n11. The incorrect pin: I find it very hard to believe they didn’t share pins. \n\n12. The deleted photo\n\n13. The photo of the back of Kris’s head. I see wounds or bruises at the base of her neck. Or, evidence of decomposition. Those dark marks are suspect to me.\n\nI feel like something spooked them and they ran off the trail maybe. And that perhaps someone eventually caught up with them. They might have even been held against their will in the middle of the jungle.",

Or maybe they thought it was an animal and attempted to scare it with the camera flash? Maybe the last photo actually caught the killers face or something identifiable so he/she took their belongings, permanently deleted the one photo, then dropped the camera and phones at a random location to only confuse investigators and sway the theory away from murder.",

        "text": "I'd like to offer some insight on the random pictures in absolute darkness.  I'm @14:45 for reference so I apologize if this has been covered or will be covered shortly.  When I saw the images they instantly reminded me of a scary experience I had that my camera potentially saved me.  \n\nI am a photographer who while on a trip to a dark zone (Lake Powell, Utah), decided to try my luck at some landscapes with the milky way.  I scoped out a spot during the afternoon that was literally 50 yards from our camp on the shoreline but a 1/4 mile hike because the camp was at the base of a canyon.  I found an easy path up and down the steep canyon walls that involved just a bit of scrambling, but I did it in flip flops multiple times and was ready.  Golden hour hits, I hike to the rim and post up, I start taking photo after photo into the night.  I am excited because it's the last night and every single night before, just as the sky would get dark enough for the milky way, the full moon would rise.  This was the first night that it would stay below the horizon long enough to shoot the milky way.  So it's like 12 am by the time the moon is lighting up the entire back and foreground so I decide to pack up and head back.  But then I instantly realize I have a problem.  I am standing in the shadow of a giant sandstone butte and I can barely see a thing.  I get back to the general area where I knew the little path back down was but I could not find it.  I walked back and forth for 20 minutes and started to get impatient.  I was about to just go for it and so glad I didn't before I had an idea.  My camera does not have a flash, a Nikon D780 and I had a wide angle f2.8.  I thought at first the screen would be bright enough to show me the way but it did nothing.  Finally I just cranked the ISO way up and took a few 10 or 20 second exposures and I turned night into daylight.  I could now see that I was standing directly above a 50 foot drop and that my path was further back the way I had came.  Snapping pics all along the way, I had no doubt now where I was going and I could suddenly see in the dark.  \n\nPerhaps some of the random shots were simply the girl(s) attempting to find their way in complete darkness?",

All this points to rape and murder to me not lost at all.  There was one of the men killed had a camera with a photo of the girls at the springs with a few local men who were in a gang of bad dudes a sex traffic deal might of went sour turned into Rape then they got rid of the bodies when the heat turned up in the area. I think the girls were disposed of for there organs in the end all the men who knew what happen DIED by drowning and one was hit by a hit and run car.  All of it looks shady guys I think one of the girls bodies was sold for parts and her bones bleached to hid the evidence the other was raped and murdered odds are over and over its why they found skin from her so much later.  These girls were targeted from day one it wasn't by chance they knew they were coming the cab driver who picked them up notified those involved then he disappeared the day after the girls turned up drowned i  All this points to he knew everything was silenced making it not a accident or lost at all.  THIS WAS MURDER ONE !  I will post a link to a another video that gives so much more including a key witness who remains hidden for safety she left the country to protect herself from everyone even the Government looks bad in this case.            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCaD8kRTwsI   here it is and part 2   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du1y_jRiiGU   both worth watching listen to the case see what you think.",

        "text": "Theory:\n\nWhen the girls reached the end of the trail the girls began to walk back.  On the way back they encountered Feliciano Gonzalez and friends(maybe including his son and Plineo Montenegro). Feliciano started to molest them and threaten them with his machete. He then told them to march on along one of the trails. He menaced Lisanne with his machete and threatened to harm her if Kris ran away. He told Lisanne to take a couple photos of on the trail, so as to have evidence on the camera to show they had continued on the trail. He directed them which way to go until they reached his coffee farm. He took them to a cave or building near or on the farm. He and his friends raped the girls. He tied them up so they could not escape. He may have deliberately hobbled them by dropped something very heavy on their feet. With the girls imprisoned on his farm he returned to Boquete to visit the place where they were staying. The girls had either secreted the phones on their persons or they were left in a place where it was possible for them to gain access to them with care. Maybe Feliciano knew there would be no phone connection. Feliciano and friends returned repeatedly over a period of days to the farm to rape the girls. He gave them some food and water. Finally after a number of days when he had lost interest in them and when the hunt for the girls was picking up he ended up killing them both Kris first and Lisanne later. He planted evidence such as the bones and the backpack. The night time photos, I am not sure, I guess were most likely taken by the men and not the girls as I can't see why Lisanne would take a photo of the back of Kris's head. I would think that most of the remains of the girls are on or near his farm.\n\nThis gives a clear idea of my train of thought. I am not claiming that every  detail is exactly as I describe it, it is possible that some things happened slightly differently.\n\nI think that it is quite inappropriate to harass Mr. Feliciano Gonzalez. Someone is innocent until proven guilty. Having said, from all I know about the case he would be my prime suspect. It is unfortunate that DNA and fingerprints were not analysed. I daresay he selected/planted only the bones which did not have signs of foul play and that is why the other body parts haven't been discovered. Has anyone taken DNA samples from Feliciano or taken his fingerprints? If you can find his DNA or fingerprints where they aren't supposed to be according to his story then you have got something. For example, his DNA or fingerprints should not be on Kris's shorts as supposedly they were not found by him. I would suspect that his DNA is all over the items in their backpack much more so than if he just found it. It might be possible to find traces of his DNA on bones that were found by others. Where are these items of evidence now: the bones, the shoe, the backpack etc. ?\n\nHis farm should be thoroughly searched and where appropriate tested for fingerprints and DNA, even the slightest evidence that could show that the girls had been on or near that farm would be crucial.",

I do not necessarily believe they were using the flash to light up the trail. I think they were using the flash to try to see someone who was out there. I cannot imagine a more terrifying situation to be in. I've slept in the woods. I've gone out intentionally without a tent and I am very much at home out there. BUT to be out there, alone, with no means to communicate KNOWING someone or something was out there in the dark.... harrowing doesn't begin to describe that hike. That photo is crucial and I think someone still has it.",

What if the killer threatened her to unlock the phone and delete photo? After deleting it, maybe he killed the owner. Afterwards the killer wanted to check if the photo was deleted, but wasn't able to successfully unlock the phone. But in that case, why did he just left the phone there? If he wanted to get rid of the evidence he could have just throw it away. Maybe to confuse us? If the phone would have been disposed of, the possibility of a third party would have been even more obvious. But what about the photos afterwards? They were clearly used to help navigating in the night. Maybe the killer himself found himself lost. So he wasn't a native. But yet again, i doubt even a native would know his way around a forest. I need to rewatch the video, i will update this if I find anything new.",

        "text": "My theory after spending hours and hours of watching videos about this case is this: They went to the top of the hill, then returned back to the village. People that saw them claimed it was later in the day and it would be possible to climb the hill and come back just in the time to be spotted by locals on their way back. Some even say they were taken by a car by some local guys. Those local guys? The son of guide F and his friends. They took the girls to the waterfalls since they were interested in seeing them and we can also see proof of that on the photo from the Gonzales' phone. Two guys from the gang (later found dead) and two women: one redhead, the other, although in the water with just her head and torso sticking out, clearly taller than the other woman. Froon was 184 cm tall, how many women in Panama and so white-skinned do you see in Panama regularly? not many. I am convinced they are in that photo. Later they tried to harvest their organs or kill them, we will probably never know, but that is when the girls tried to run away, or at least one of them managed to. All alone in the forest, not knowing the road back to the village, they/she was using the camera to light the way in front of her while being followed. Maybe it was both of them, maybe they left both phones in one backpack that only one of them now had with her and was trying to call 911....she later gets caught, killed...her personal belongings were looked through and they found an incriminating photo so they connected the phone to the pc and deleted it. That's why so many fingerprints have been found on the phone and other stuff. Later when the case got a huge press coverage some of the guys from the gang started backing out, being suspicious and guide F and his son were afraid they might tell something so they killed all the witnesses. This is the theory that makes the most sense to me.",

        "text": "On every true crime video, it seems there's someone who comments how out of the many, many true crime cases they've watched, THAT one is the that sticks with them the most. This is that case for me--well, tied with the whole Turtle Island Thailand gang-corruption-coverup murders haha. \n\nAny theory on this case (or derivative) get be picked apart so it's frustrating. Some things start to make sense in your mind, it's all clicking together, and then you go \"but wait, what about the ___ \" So yeah the only thing i'm certain of is that i'm not certain. I do notice however, that people who support the theory that they just got lost (whether coupled with an animal attack, a fall of a cliff, effects of dehydration etc.) don't seem able or willing to refute arguments for the (a) foul play theory. \n\nEven to believe they were kidnapped by a gang would open up so many more questions that have left people scratching their heads. But I tend to lean towards some form of the foul play theory, and here why.\n\nPoints that contradict the theory that they just got lost:\n\n1) the backpack -- it was found 70 days after the girls' disappearance, beside a river bank 15 km away from the pianista trail. The lady who found it said she was at the same spot the day before but didn't see any backpack there. The backpack was NOT wet -- it was in pristine condition and the items inside were dry and appeared untouched. The phones and digital camera were in there, so it becomes difficult to see how the girls could've been the ones taking the pictures and calling emergency services in the jungle for 11 days, and yet the backpack doesn't get wet or dirty, and somehow makes a long journey on its own without getting wet. \n\n2) Lisanne's severed left foot was found in her hiking boot, and the cut was clean -- This disproves any animal attack theory and shows a human being cut off her foot. Unless Pokemon are real and a Scyther jumped out and cut her foot off, then it was a human. It can't be argued that an animal could have done that, plus the boot was clean and still tied to her foot, with no sign of scratches or claw marks\n\nHonestly, I don't see how anyone can believe they just got lost given the above 2 points. Ok let's tack on some more for goal differential :P\n\n3) Pictures -- I'm hoping people have watched/read other things about this case, to gather more details. The daytime pictures and nighttime pictures tell completely different (albeit incomplete) stories. \n\nTimeline: they start their hike on April 1st. Yikes, I didn't even notice that was April Fool's, ugh. \n\n-> daytime pictures - The girls are smiling. These are the ones at the foot of the trail, along it and leading up to them reaching the peak where I wish they had been able to turn back. In the strange pictures of Kris beside the stream of water and crouched by the bushes, she's not smiling at all and some believe at this point they were either kidnapped or had run into another group and knew they were dangerous.\n\n These initial pictures were taken before 1:30-2:00pm, so that refutes the taxi driver saying he dropped them off at that time. Nope, he might've just misremembered but this notion that they started their hike at 2pm is simply false. MORE on that taxi driver in a bit ....\n\n> nighttime pictures - After 2pm on April 1st, no one used the camera for 7 days. It just doesn't make sense, if they were alone and simply lost, to not have a SINGLE picture of them, or anything in the daytime for that matter. But then on April 8th, someone took more than 90 photos in less than 3 hours - those hours were between 1am-4am. This is where the \"they just got lost\" camp suggests that these photos were meant to light up the area so they could see their surroundings, perhaps signal an airplane or search party, or perhaps scare off an animal they (or rather just she, by this point) might have heard. I have to admit, whyy would kidnappers be out at 1-4am taking pictures though? Best chance to not be seen as they make it look like the girls took the pictures in the jungle? Oh, I dunno. But then again, WHY was there 0 camera activity for 7 days?\n\nThen there's the deleted photo and this one's a mammoth. Keep in mind that pictures were taken on a digital camera, not their phones. A computer must be used to fully erase a photo, and the Canon company itself confirmed this. It makes a strong argument that the girls managed to get a picture of something or someone incriminating, and whoever kidnapped them (* cough Feliciano Gonzales) had to have deleted the picture. \n\n4) Phones -- alright so on the first day, April 1st, the first emergency call to 112 was placed just after 4:30pm. Then a call was placed to 911 but didn't get through. Then phones turned off for 14 hours. Again, why? If they were lost and had their phones, how do they both go 14 hours without having their phone on? \n\nIn total, they made about 80 calls. On day 5 (April 5th) LIsanne's phone died. Kris's phone stayed on until day 11 but between April 7th-10th Kris's phone was off/had no activity. It was turned on again, for the last time, at 10:51am on April 11th. It was turned off exactly an hour later at 11:51am, and this was the end of any phone activity. \n\nOn April 6th, there were several attempts to enter an incorrect code. There were dozens of attempts up until April 11th. The girls obviously would have exchanged pass codes so it's very unlikely that Lisanne would've been locked out of Kris's phone. Plus, they didn't need a pass code to make an emergency call so investigators concluded it was unlikely to have been Lisanne trying to enter the code. The girls hadn't called home or the place they were staying, or anything other than emergency services in those 11 days so that seemed a bit strange. Why \"dozens\" of attempts to enter a phone, unless it was kidnappers looking for photos or something before they plant the phones in the backpack and leave them by the river. \n\n5) Tour guide / gang members \nOh I gotta wrap this up. No one's reading anyway but I can't sleep so let's write until the eyes get heavy haha. Okay but yeah, let's go over some of these characters.\n\nFeliciano Gonzales - the tour guide\nInternet sleuths like me believe he's our guy. He basically IS a red flag, everything that he does. The girls were supposed to meet with Feliciano but they didn't. So after the girls went missing, he went over to the place they were staying and was in the girls' room for 30 minutes. There wasn't a door key in the backpack that was found, which doesn't make sense. Then of course it's Feliciano who spotted the boot with Lisanne's severed foot in it, and other bones. 33 bones were discovered, one pair of jean shorts, and one shoe from each of the girls. Then there was a rolled up ball of human skin. Then you look at Feliciano's tripadvisor reviews online and the one where he threatens a woman with a machete sticks out. Machete, clean cut above the ankle, hmm. OH, and then the suspicious deaths. Over 10 people connected to the case have died, including 4 member of the Los gang. The one gang member who survived? Henri Elizas Gonzales, Feliciano's son. Alright. \n\nTaxi driver -- named Leonardo Gonzales -- drove the girls to la pianista, told police he saw a pickup truck near where he dropped the girls off. He was found dead in a river, 7 months after the girls' disappearance.\n\nGang member 1 - Osman Velezuales (23 years old) - died April 4th (3 days after the girls' disappearance). \n\n2 - Juan Rivera Miranda (24)\n3 - Jorge Murgas (23)\n4 - Adonis Henriberto (23)\n\nOne was drowned in a shallow pool, one hit and run, and I forget the other. I'm tired, still need to look up another supposed suspect named Plineo Montenegro. \n\nBut yeah, again no one will have read this but forgive the long rant, anyway. This case just has so many strange elements to it. I mean, the girls actually had a compass, a solar power bank, and a knife in their room. They obviously would've taken these if they planned to go on a long hike, which further makes me believe they were intercepted at some point on the trail. \n\nIt just seems obvious that there was foul play involved. Foul play's a euphemism for what Lisanne and Kris went through, and I can't see any way they just got lost. Again they didn't pack much, they didn't take any daytime photos after the first 2 hours of their hike, the condition of the bone fragments, the knowledge of gang/police/government corruption in Panama, all of it. If they were lost, wouldn't they have tried to mark where they've been? It's dense jungle but even little pieces of clothing tied to a tree could be seen by people searching. What about trying to make SOS signs out of rocks or sticks?> Or at least make piles of random sticks and brush so you'll know you've been there before, and people searching can tell a human made those piles. \n\nI dunno, it just seems a bit disrespectful to the girls and their lives to believe they were foolish and got lost. Just think, if Lisanne or Kris was your daughter, would you be able to look at this case and accept that the girls must've just got lost? Evidence for them being lost pales in comparison to them being kidnapped, does it not?\n\nThen again, I could be wrong :)",

        "text": "In the disappearance of these two Dutch girls, there are two situations that I don't understand and I believe that need a more careful analysis:\n1-If in the first two calls to the Dutch emergency number, they were already under the control of kidnappers, why didn't the criminals take the phones, the camera and all their belongings?\n\nThis doesn't make any sense! No offenders with murderous or sexual intentions would risk being photographed by their victims, or even risk the girls calling the police or leaving a message recorded on their cell phones for when they are found by the authorities.\n\n2- Why don't you have any attempt to call 911 during the night?\n\nWhat would be the worst moment for two girls from an urban environment, lost in the middle of a tropical jungle?\nDo you agree with me that this worst moment would be to spend the night in the forest?! Exhausted, cold, with animals moving on the ground, animal movement in the dark forest, a plague of insects, rain spray, hunger, thirst and darkness everywhere. This would undoubtedly be the time when they would most try to connect to an emergency number, but they didn't.\n\nTrying to explain these two situations, the best way to harmonize was as follows:\nLisanne and Kris decided on their own, to continue the trail past the viewpoint, when they realized they couldn't make it back before nightfall, or because they really got lost and disoriented, they decided to make the first two calls in the late afternoon of April 1st. . Without success, they must surely have screamed for help. They were certainly answered and rescued by someone who heard them both scream, or someone who somehow passed them on the trail. This would explain why the girls did not attempt to call an emergency number during the night, that is, they felt safe to be accompanied by someone they believed to be trustworthy and well intentioned.\nAfter that, they certainly went with that someone, to some nearby property, where they continued to be deceived by lies that reassured them, but that at dawn and after a night's sleep, they always tried to make another emergency call, until the cell phone battery has discharged.\nIt was at that moment that this someone realized that they were totally incommunicado and certainly decided to attack and take their belongings that were all inside the backpack.\nFrom then on, all the evil that befell the girls began.\n\nIn my opinion, between the moment the last cell phone ran out of charge and the dawn of the 8th, Kris Kremers was killed, so in the photos taken on the 8th, only the hair of a lifeless body of Kris appears, trying to simulate a disappearance, with them lost in the night trying to signal their position in the woods and kris dead in Lisanne's arms (who doesn't appear in the photos) as it's the killer planting false evidence, not Lisanne!\n\nAs the pieces of Lisanne Froon's skin were found in mid-June, in an initial state of decomposition, this shows that Lisanne was killed in early June and was under the control of this someone who killed her, for about 60 days. She was the last to die.\n\nNote 1: Seeing the holes in Kris' Jeans, it shows that her dead body was dragged a short distance, where it was thrown. That is, this may indicate that the place where Kris and Lisanne were killed and the bodies were subjected to a chemical treatment for dismemberment and then concealment, are very close to each other, and may be in the vicinity of this property where they felt \"safe\" .\n\nNote 2: Kris' boot found, was it clean and without any remains inside? No animal in the forest, would be interested in carrying a leather boot in her mouth! It's not food! That's how the animals would see this boot, any object, they would have smelled it and gone. That boot was taken to the forest by the killer.\n\nNote 3: The police know of more evidence, maybe even the photo that was deleted. At the very least, they want to make some strategic use.\n\nConclusion: Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon, were held captive in an environment they thought was safe, were killed, stripped naked, with the bodies being dismembered by some chemical process as yet unknown. Some dismembered parts, along with the girls' boots, clothes and backpack with all the girls' belongings, were deliberately abandoned along the straight-line trail to create false leads and simulate that the girls died of hunger and thirst after getting lost in the deep in the forest.\n\nThe death of these innocent girls touched me a lot! This is my small contribution to unravel their deaths and thus lead to a punishment, the possible murderer and the possible collaborators.\n\nFortaleza-CE, Brazil.\n\nI very much hope that Jesus Christ will comfort Kris and Lisanne's parents.",

        "text": "To Scarlett. You have done a tremendous amount of work on this case. I only heard about this horrific tragedy 3 days ago. I have read a day's worth of your work. In the beginning of my own research I was more on the fence and receptive to the lost in the woods theory. In general it would be the most likely scenario. But as you've clearly argued in all of your work, this is no ordinary disappearance. I have spent a lot of time on the 'lost' theory because I feel that it should be 100 percent ruled out before claiming things we have no proof for. But I definitely lean foul play. If the facts of this case are to be believed there are just too many  coincidences for it to be simply getting lost. Even though getting lost and succumbing to the elements  would be a likely scenario, I think the conspiracy theory here is actually coming from those who want blame inexperienced yet intelligent and cautious women. Like how do these foul play deniers explain Lisanne's rolled up ball of skin and foot in boot with skin just lying undisturbed for Feliciano to find right after all that reward money was offered? Kris' bleached pelvic bone? I've l heard the rebuttals and they're extremely weak. The thing about the getting lost theory is it makes sense until you familiarize yourself with the trail. It's straightforward. Hard to deviate from. There's also traffic. The injury theory makes little sense as both girls would have to be injured to the point of being unable to walk. Highly unlikely and as evidenced in the walk along videos there's nowhere along the path the girls could have got that severely injured before their first emergency call. The phone usage, or lack thereof, after 4:51 pm for me is the most damning thing. Their first night lost alone in the woods and neither turns their phone on again for 14 hours? I get that it would be intelligent to conserve battery power. I just don't believe anybody in that situation would or could sit in pitch black cool as a cucumber for 7 days straight. They couldn't have been that far away at 4:39 the time of their first emergency call. They had no reason to conserve their battery power if they believed they could probably hike back day 2 first thing. To me it is supposing way too much to say both girls were injured to the point of not being able to call for help on the trail. It's too much to say one couldn't walk or try to crawl back to Boquette for help. The girls did not send one pending message to loved ones that would automatically send if they happened upon service. They left no photos or video messages for 11 days with battery power. And photo 509 was deleted manually off a computer unless some absolute miracle took place. The conspiracy theorist here is the one lacking context making general assumptions. The ones who want to believe Panama is no more dangerous than their comfortable first world community. It's really hard not to be biased in favor of the foul play theory if you are honest with yourself about the lost theory inconsistencies. There is always the chance these girls got lost and were then eventually abducted. But in my opinion their lack of attempting help after 4:51 pm April 1st for the next 14 hours leads me to believe either their phones were taken from them. Or. This might be easily debunked. But is it possible there were photos taken and deleted from the phones and camera before the 99 taken on April 8th? Because surely there'd be no sign of these photos taken before the 8th unless competent law enforcement sought to look into potentially deleted files. The login pins on both phones were successfully typed in the first 4 days. So it would seem likely the girls had at least partial access to their phones. Maybe they werent kidnapped in the sense that we think of at gun point violently. Like some men were forcing them to stay with them off trail out of wifi service and threatened violence if a phone were used. All speculation, but that would make sense of why the phones were hardly ever used but the login attempts remained accurate. Again though maybe the girls were forced into giving up their login codes so whoever might have kidnapped them could delete what could have incriminated them. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me that someone could become so disoriented through hypothermia that they couldn't ever again remember their simple login. It is possible though. But it still doesn't explain away never taking a photo or video of anything sensible for over a week yet they logged in and out. To me it's clear these women couldn't openly use their phones or camera when they wanted. The technology usage of first worlders is minute to minute. The usage of people living in Panama would be here and there once or twice a day. That's how those pieces of technology were used after 4:51 pm. Once or twice a day. Panama is a dangerous place with a lot of murder. There are experienced murderers and shitty law enforcement. Those arguing the lost theory want to believe in it so bad for their own little ego trip or because they're lacking necessary context. I look at it as more of a virtue signaling to other reasonable explanation people looking for quick resolution. There was an alleged murderer in the US who was just charged and due to his being video recorded by his child victims. Had he kept the girls alive long enough to extract a login pin and social media password he could have erased the video evidence entirely. This to me is why the criminals in the Kris and Lisanne case were so preoccupied with the phone. The lost in the wood side would say why not destroy the phones, camera and backpack and be done with it. That happened to that Alex guy on that trail 5 years earlier. Disappeared into thin air. So it was treated like a crime. Had evidence of a body or belonging been planted that case wouldn't have been under the microscope. That's why I believe body parts and belongings were released back into the woods. In hopes to pass off the murders as human error. I think potential criminals woulda weighed this destroying all evidence option at first but were trying really hard to cover their tracks with the phone. Meanwhile most likely trying to blend in and contributing to the manhunt that first week. To make sure they weren't being incriminated. I also believe a third party would hold onto the phone while they eliminated all other evidence first. That spot where the possible sos was photographed was likely where the bodies were. One thing that does bother me about the foul play theory though is DNA on the phones and camera. Was there any DNA found or looked for? You would think it would be difficult to eliminate all DNA traces without some sort of noticeable damage. So strange though that the phones were just found neatly packed away. And if I remember correctly there was like some traces of edible snack in the bag. You would think in starvation that would be gobbled up. So many things make no sense and it's human nature to try and find a plausible answer. Some people dream up over the top scenarios, others downplay everything and want the most basic, reasonable explanation based on their own mundane human experience. To me most of everything on both sides cancels itself out or is inadequately explained. Except for the body parts found and the absence/lack of phone/camera use until the early morning hours of the 8th. Nothing can explain away these things for me. To argue otherwise and assume murderers arent intelligent enough or capable enough to cover their tracks is just downright naive. Anyway those are my 2 cents.",

Photo of Mirror on another Rock can also means that the mirror was being used to amply the signal by reflecting it toward other directions. One of the photos shows Kremers' head that can imply she is unconscious or dead around April 8. \n2). Assuming that Kremers is dead on April 8. Now, Froon's phone is dead and she possibly didn't know Kremers' phone password so she tries to attempt entering kremers' phone hence the wrong PIN attempt after 8th April and till 11th April and Froon dies on 11th or a day after.\n3). The backpack and dead bodies are found after 11th April by someone local and they steal their backpack. The search and the story blows up and the local who found the backpack gets scared and decided to lay low to avoid accountability (as reward was probably announced after 10 day search which would have been after 11th April).\n4). The locals with backpack feels guilty and wants the bodies to be found so they clean it properly and systematically place it near their initial location where it can be easily found. \n\nUnexplained or Questionable Data (Probably rumours): \n\n1). \"Panamanian forensic anthropologist's assessment that bones had no marks\" hardly qualifies as a forensics conclusion and can also indicate natural decomposition. \n2). Can't find any verifiable on discovery of Bones of other humans.\n3). \"Shorts found zipped and neatly folded\" came out to be a rumour. \n4). Can't find verifiable data about \"professionally deleted photo\".",

Like you said, the sudden flash of the camera doesn't help much, but a steady mostly lit up image of blone hair is perhaps more helpful if held close to the ground at least?

Her hair looked completely clean and not like she had been wondering around in a jungle for days. It just doesn't add up. As unsettling as it even is to say, I genuinely wonder if she was even alive in the photo. Also, I wonder what kind of camera they had. Because some digital cameras can take videos, and if I was lost in a jungle with a camera that could take videos, I would record a video to tell my family I loved them and explain what happened to me. Sometimes I wonder if those photos were even taken by them at all, or if they were used as a distraction to make people think they were just lost. And if someone else took those photos, they used the photo of the back of her head to make people think they were taking these photos. And if Kris wasn't alive in that photo, then taking an odd picture like that would make sense because if they pictured her face, it'd be obvious she wasn't alive. Especially with the way the hair is positioned in the photo. Like her hair is either laid out on the floor, or her hands are under it lifting it up.  I don't think what happened to them was just simply getting lost or from natural causes. Something more sinister happened here and so many things were over looked with the evidence. I wish there was a way to know what happened because this case makes my brain hurt. It just doesn't make sense.",

        "text": "Here's what Occam's razor tells us. The girls finished the hike quicker than they expected and decided to walk on a bit further (or they thought it was a loop track). People, including their parents, say it's impossible to wonder of the trail because it is so obvious. But that doesn't factor in if they intentionally went off the trail because they ran out of water. It has been established that they took very little water on their hike that day. They could hear the river nearby so they went down to fill their water bottles. Unfortunately they didn't realise how steep it was and they slipped and fell and suffered critical injuries. People wonder why they didn't try more emergency calls, it's because they were stuck in the same spot the entire time, broken backs or broken legs or broken hips, or all of these. They tried to conserve battery by switching their phones off. But they realised the emergency calls were futile given the lack of service in that one spot. The girls sheltered against the cliff and spread their rubbish to signal to anyone looking over the cliff or from the sky. One photo shows the white papers forming an SOS. The red plastic bags (proven to be from the village) was also a signal/marker while they sheltered closer to the cliff to stay out of the elements. They tried to take a photo of Kris head injury. Kris eventually dies. Lisanne either doesn't know or forgot Kris' pincode after her own phone battery died. The reason they went silent for a week is because they knew it was futile. They decided to conserve battery and wait for help. The night photos were taken because Lisanne could hear either helicopters that day/night or the audio signals the search and rescue were using. She was using the camera flash to try and signal them but slowly loses hope which is why the photos begin to slow down and get further apart. This may have also been Lisannes last efforts to signal for help before succumbing to her injuries/dehydration/starvation. If you want to find the site where they died it is somewhere upstream (obviously) from the evidence found, bones, backpack, shorts etc. The river Changuinolla starts not far from El Mirador. The location they died will be on the western side of the river on a steep section with a large rock and open canopy somewhere between the location of the shorts and El Mirador. If you can find this location there will be some remnants of the rubbish they left. It will also be where the animals pulled apart their bodies so perhaps there would even be some bones, hopefully for the families sakes, the skulls. The missing photo was either a glitch in the camera software or the Panamanian police deleted it, that is the ONLY conspiracy theory worth investigating. There was no foul play, no murder, no gangs, no cartel, no Photoshop (absolute nonsense). Just two girls that slipped and fell and suffered unimaginable pain and fear for a week in the Panamanian jungle. Someone please find this location so the girls May finally rest in peace.",

Deux hypothèses supplémentaires : soit l'effacement a partir de l'appareil est complètement sécurisé (il réécrit sur ces données -a mon avis peu probable-), soit le gars qui a fait l'expertise de cette carte était de mèche-ou pas assez compétent. Ca aurait été parfait si le gars avait renommé la dernière photo de la série de 90 en photo 509, mais il n'y a pas pensé apparemment.",

There are 2 things to know about the jungle at night:\n\n1) It is PITCH black. You can’t even see your hand in front of your face. The trees block out the moon and stars.\n\n2) The jungle comes alive at night. You hear rustling bushes, scampering feet, and animals making all sorts of noises\n\nThere have been many times I’ve turned on my flashlight in the middle of the night just to figure out what is making noises. It can be frightening, especially without a tent for protection.\n\nMy theory is that they took the night photos because they heard animal noises and the flash was their only source of light. The close-up of her hair may have been a “is there something crawling on me??” situation",

You can notice this by how easy it is to see each strand of hair clearly. The camera was very close to kris's face or head. I would guess that Lisane took a photo of her friend's face, to see why she no longer responded (because she probably died), and ended up seeing her dead friend's face. Lissane became desperate and took several photos pointing upwards, hoping that some plane or aircraft would see the camera's flash. But without success. If you turn the photo vertically, and look closely, it appears to have a nose, and an open eye between the middle of the hair. It's something quite bizarre. But I really believe that it is a photo of Kris already dead.",

Après tout, ça n'aurait surpris personne, dans l'hypothèse d'un accident, que toutes les affaires n'aient pas été retrouvées... J'ai du mal à comprendre pourquoi les agresseurs se seraient compliqué la vie avec la suppression de cette photo, en prenant en plus un risque (il faut être sûr de son coup si la photo était effectivement compromettante). Car au final l'appareil photo était-il indispensable à la mise en scène d'un accident ? Ou alors les agresseurs souhaitaient que les 90 photos \"bizarres\" soient visionnées ? Mais là aussi, je ne vois pas ce que quelqu'un serait censé déduire de ces photos....ça ne sert pas vraiment la mise en scène à mon sens... Bon c'était juste une petite réflexion !",

        "text": "I'm certain it was not foul play and I can give natural explanations for pretty much all the unusual events.\n     I believe they made it to the second monkey bridge and Kris fell off it and was severely injured. This was when the first emergency call attempt was made.\n     For five days, almost perfectly routine, they made attempts to contact emergency services. They gave up trying on the 6th of April to make any more attempts.\n      They never left the river where Kris was injured. Probably a broken leg or fractured foot. \n     The night photos on the 8th make perfect sense. They were trying to illuminate the tree canopy to create a larger signal beacon. It failed because no hikers or native villagers would have been out in the rain to see it.\n     I believe they survived up to the 11th. But I think Kris might not of woke up on the morning of the 11th and Lisanne tried in a very weakened state to try emergency call.\n    If you get into their minds. \n\nFor 5 days you try emergency calls, yelling for help. \n     \"Where are the searchers? Is no one coming? No one cares that we have been gone for five days?\"\n    \n Now you tack on five more days. By the 11th of April they gave up. No one cares we have been missing for 10 days. Hopelessness sets in, you are starving, exhausted, wet and possibly in physical pain.\n      Why was the night photo of Kris's hair \"clean\" and \"dry\".\nKris probably used one of the backpacks as a pillow. The tangled hair kind of proves sleeping on a backpack.\n     $83 found in one backpack. Seems strange that a 3rd party wouldn't just take the money.\n     It seems silly that some suggest the camera photos were edited by 3rd party but I see zero evidence of that theory.\n     The \"missing\" 509 photo. Nope not missing at all. The SD card had been removed. The photo button pressed with no card slotted and it counted 509 into memory. No flash is triggered when you do this. So the memory SD card was reinserted and photo 510 was recorded and allowed the flash to trigger. \n    Why was the SD card first removed? They wanted to use the flash as a beacon but didn't want to save the photos. But they discovered the flash won't trigger if the SD card is not inserted.\n     They both died of natural causes very close to the river. Scavenger animals fed on their bodies. The river washed down their remains taking the backpacks with it.\n     Why was Kris's jean shorts removed?\nThey had gotten soaked on the night April 7th to early morning of the 8th. The next dry day probably the 10th Lisanne took them to dry them in the sun. They were never put back on because Kris had passed a way.",

        "text": "I have a different theory from most people.\n\nFirst I don’t believe the dog blue was ever there, no evidence or photos of the dog therefore I conclude it was not with the girls during the hike.  I believe that lisanne and kris went to the Panama and successfully returned,  why? Because in the first photo you can see lisanne has the backpack on and this was the very first photo taken.  In the last photo you can now see kris has the backpack on and on this last photo both kris & lisanne have a smile with thumbs up,  this to me indicates we have finished our hike and now heading back!  The backpack being changed from lisanne to kris from first to last photo is reasonable to believe that maybe they had an agreement , lisanne wears the backpack on way there and kris wears it on the way back. To me everything seems to indicate they actually returned from the hike.\n\nI believe that when they returned they encountered someone wether this is someone they previously saw/met or not I couldn’t tell you but they definitely encountered someone where they then went out somewhere else and my theory is that when they arrived at this other location with this mystery man, kris and lisanne took a photo at this location together which was then deleted by the mystery man because he didn’t want this location being shown.  \n\nThis to me seems like the most probable case scenario something along these lines. I don’t know why the time gaps of calling 911 calls where so odd  but as for the digital camera shots up in the sky, my belief is that maybe the man did these shots that way when the camera is found investigators would believe that this shows kris and lisanne was lost and trying to use it as light or help. I definitely think a lot of staging was involved.",

        "text": "Consider that there are Several photographs taken apparently in just one or so minutes as the two friends arrive on the summit at 13.00pm, the next photo is then of Kris Kremers racing down the gully at 13.20pm looking back joyously at the camera. So, how long were the two at the top and how long does it take to get from the summit to this Gulley? From what Hans Kremers indicates here the gully is just as you leave the summit. There is another 34 minutes till the next photo - at the stream - and according to Hans Kremers apparently it takes 45 minutes thereabouts to reach the stream location from the summit, so the gulley must be just as you leave the summit to head down. The last photo of the day is marked on the camera as 13.54pm with the two reaching the stream. Meaning that according to the Kremers own timing Kris and Lisanne would have been on the summit for around ten minutes... indeed allow for the fact that the Kremers here are walking in muddy conditions and with a party, while Kris and Lisanne were younger and moving over dry ground in good weather, and I suggest that there may well be a considerable time spent on the Summit, in fact if the Photo of Kris in the gulley looking back at Lisanne is stamped as 13.20pm and the gulley is just as you leave the Summit you would have close to twenty minutes of them proved to be on the Summit. One minute or so to energetically shoot several very quick photo's as they arrive there apparently and they abruptly stop, what then were they doing then for the next fifteen minutes or more?\r Before they decide to descend the other side?\n\r\nIt does make you wonder whether at this point, as they arrived there on the Summit and celebrated, does someone arrive and talk them into a trip down the other side with him...? We can never know. But it does make sense then as to why it is Kris is always seen ahead by that point, the path is not big enough for three people together, at least one of them has to walk out in front.\r\n\r\nIt is a very interesting possibility to think on.",

        "text": "They got lost 100% (I excuse for a certain length of the following comment)\n\nWhy would a perpetrator wait so long ? A Jungle at night is pitch black, you cant see your own hand, its that dark. So if there was someone he would have lead them into the forest, killed them and then would have taken their belongings to a place no one would look for, all in daylight, the forest would make it possible. \n\nIn the night, there is a high chance the perpetrator himself would not be able to orientate very well and get lost himself, especially considering how far in they already were...its just unnecessary. \n\nIts much much much more likely they got lost:\nTo me it seems Kris was the more naive one, doesnt want to carry a backpack, is always walking in front and seems very curious overall. \nThey both were highly unexperienced with the terrain, underprepared in regard to equipment and ill informed about a route that was difficult to navigate even for locals. I mean they both came from a highly urbanised country...the weather was very nice that day and overall there is a trail that they can follow....why not just walk a bit further down the path and see what we can find (maybe they heard rumors about secret places or stuff like that). The photos implicate a certain light hearted attitude. On the last daytime photo Kris does look a bit uncertain tho, no bright smile like in the other photos. I think at that point they realized they got lost but didnt panic or think of any mortal consequences. After that daytime photos stop, probably because at that point there were way more important things to do than take silly photos (search network connection, try to orientate, make waypoints etc.) \n\nThen come the nighttime photos. These got analyzed in depth (you cant really get more out of these at this point) and the overall concensus is that they tried to either orientate or more probably to signal their location, hence a lot of them are at the same spot and directed in the sky. At that point panic had set in for sure. Anyone who got lost once in a forest knows that panic sets in faster and faster the lower the sun sets, I cant imagine how horrified I would be in a south american jungle with all the animal noises plus being dehydrated and disoriented. \n\nI think Kris was the first who couldnt move forward at some point, possibly due to an injury like a fracture from a fall (the terrain would make that easy especially at night and panicked)\nI think Lisanne was the more collected one, making almost all the photos and trying to use Kris phone.\nLisanne did sustain a injury herself, evident by the fracture on the foot that was found. \nFirst Kris was unable to move, Lisanne tried to call for help and at some point had an accident herself, so that both of them succumbed to the elements. Rain and the small river scattered their remains.",

        "text": "Why I Think Foul Play Was Involved:\n\n1) Kris' hair appears to look way too good, after 8 long days lost in the jungle.\n\nSpending 8 days in a jungle with lots of rain, dirt, plants, insects, etc. and your hair being that clean 8 days after getting lost in a jungle is just ridiculous. Many speculate that Kris fell and got injured early on in their disappearance, you mean to tell me she fell and her hair was completely untouched? no twigs, dirt, nothing? okay. I'm sorry but personally my hair would look completely messed up after 1 night being lost in a jungle, never mind 8.\n\nSome say that Kris' might of washed her hair, I just really doubt that.\n\nFirst, you think her dirty hair would really be a concern for her, being lost for days in a foreign jungle far far from home?\n\nSecond, they had no hair products on them. Washing hair with just river water would leave it looking frizzy, not like the hair that looks like on photos from April 1st.\n\n2) Before going to the Pianista trail, locals have said that they saw the girls being approached by an off road vehicle.\n\nPlease be aware that I am not accusing any of these people specifically of harming the girls, as that would be not fair without more evidence.\n\nAfter the girls had a short conversation with the locals, they were approached by tour guide Feliciano's off road vehicle. Son of Feliciano, Henry Gonzalez, was driving that vehicle. He was accompanied by his friend Jose Manuel Murgas.\n\nHenry offered the girls a ride to the Pianista trail, which was only 5 minutes away from that point.\n\nThe girls accepted the ride and got to the Pianista trail to begin their hike, alone. So those boys had the information that the girls were alone.\n\nNow like I said, this doesn't mean that it was them specifically that did something to the girls, but they had the information that they were alone. Whether or not they passed on this information to other third parties, we don't know.\n\nThis is still some crucial information.\n\n3) That same off road vehicle picked up the girls after they returned\n\nThis was witnessed by 2 locals.\n\nOne of these locals was the taxi driver - Leonardo Arturo Gonzalez.\n\nLeonardo apparently knew more than he publicly stated about what he witnessed.\n\nLeonardo later was found drowned, on March 3rd 2015. Just before the case was closed.\n\nMy theory is that Leonardo was killed because he knew something that the killers didn't want him to. To prevent him from spilling this information to unwanted sources, the killers took his life.\n\nThe girls were witnessed heading to the road by locals between 2:30pm - 3:30pm, 5 hours after their start time.\n\nThis time is consistent with the time it actually takes to hike the Pianista trail, and return back from the hike.\n\nThe witness stated that the girls looked like they already walked a good amount, so it is possible that he saw them after their returned from their hike.\n\nNow to the main point, the same off road vehicle that drove the girls to the hike, picked them up from the hike. There were 3 guys in the car: Henry Gonzalez, Jose Manuel Murgas, and Osman Valenzuela.\n\nA popular theory is that they headed to Caldera Hot Springs, to relax after a long day of hiking. Seems logical to me.\n\n4) Panamanian authorities botched this case from the very beginning.\n\nA Dutch journalist mentioned the unprofessionalism by the Panamanian authorities to investigate the case at a criminal level.\n\nThis is a snippet from a video featuring what he said:\n\n\"For too long they considered a possible accident, or a possible case of them getting lost. And all that time they didn't invest in a proper criminal investigation. Therefore, very crucial time has been lost. Within hours, at the last days but ideally sooner, you need to interview all witnesses, in a very intensive and thorough manner. You need to do technical research very early on and investigate telephone data.\"\n\nIt is no secret that the Panamanian authorities neglected this case from the very beginning, how can you be this careless and irresponsible?\n\nThe families of the girls filed a lawsuit against the Panamanian authorities for the mishandling of the evidence.\n\nWere they trying to cover something up?\n\nA motive for covering the truth could be that they wanted to paint the picture that the girls were lost in order to protect their tourism reputation. That is what I personally believe.\n\n5) Tampering of camera / SD card.\n\nMost here already know about image 509 here, so I won't go in too much detail about that.\n\nBut image 509, the photo between last day photo and first night photo, was safe deleted.\n\nSafe deleting requires a special computer software.\n\nIf the image was just simply deleted from the camera, a professional would still be able to retrieve this image using a computer. That was not the case.\n\nThe Dutch authorities themselves came to a conclusion that the camera and SD card were tampered with, so this is no secret.\n\nIn my opinion, image 509 was something that the Panamanian authorities absolutely did not want anyone to see. And this doesn't have to mean that 509 showed the girls injured/dead or showed their murderers or anything like that, but it could have simply been a picture that was not on the trail or near the jungle. In order to depict their narrative of the girls being \"lost in a jungle\", the Panamanian authorities destroyed this image.",

In fact, it is obvious when you look at all the photos and realized that one girl had the hair pushed back on the way up and loose on the way down. Otherwise she would have been constantly catching and released her hair. Also, one of the girls is carrying the backpack on the way up and the other on the way down. The local authorities didn't want the area, which was a touristic one, to get famous as a unsafe area for tourists.\n- the girls were seen after the hike by the owner of a local shop at the start of the trail and were asking for a taxi or lift back to the city. They end up entering a red car, driven by some local boys. That local was never interviewed by the authorities, but he spoke to some amateur investigators and the video is on youtube.\n- one of those local boys is seen in one of the photos, swiming. The girls went home to pick their swiming suits and left right away with the boys to a waterfall. That is the reason why their bras were in the backpack, they were swiming at the waterfall, therefore they were wearing the swimming suits.\n- the crime happened in that waterfall.\n- the local guide went to their apartment and cleaned all the evidences that they returned from the hike. He did that because his son was one of the local boys that... well, used the girls to have some fun.\n- all the three boys were dead one or two years after the disappearance. Some under strange situations.\nThe idea is that they were being killed to eliminate the witnesses of the crime, and the last one was killed by someone else. The taxi driver that took them to the start of the trail was also dead soon after the facts.\n- why would anyone from Holand dial 911, when that number is irrelevant for an European? They used the 112 because that is the standard emergency number. Who dialed 911 was someone local that knew that that was the correct number, but the girls had no idea about that.\n\n- The main theory is that the local police tried to \"solve\" the case by claiming the girls did something wrong, like walking to the jungle and getting lost. They manipulated the photos to sustain that story, by taking some strange photos that couldn't be used to identify the location but to give the idea they were alive, when they were already dead. Remember that they were raped and killed in the waterfall, by those 3 boys. Probably they were kept alive some time to be rapped multiple times, but when they tried to escape they were killed.",

        "text": "Excellent video! My theory is that their captor(s) didn't realize the women still had their cell phones, so the women had to be discreet about when they attempted to call for help and do it when their captors weren't looking. This would explain why they only checked their phones or attempted to call 911 during daylight hours as lighting up their phones at night would be more noticeable. It also explains why they never checked their phones or attempted to call at exactly the same time (probably one of them was talking to / distracting their captor(s) while the other attempted it). It might explain why Froon left her phone on all night on April 2-3 and wasted so much precious battery; she almost got caught and had to stow the phone without turning it off. From April 5 onward, Kremers was either dead or incapacitated, while Froon's phone was out of power; hard to say whether it was Froon trying to operate Kremers' phone without knowing her PIN, or whether their captors had finally discovered the phones and wanted to see what was on the phones. \n\nMe personally, if I was lost in the wild, I'd probably be attempting to get a signal and call for help every hour on the hour for the first day before I'd start doing it more sporadically to conserve battery. Something or someone was preventing them from calling for help more often. \n\nBy April 8th, I think the captors had realized they f'ed up, that \"missing pretty white woman\" is a thing and the heat was on and a 6'0\" tall white woman plus a 5'7\"/5'8\" white woman weren't going to just vanish without anyone noticing, so they shot all of the nighttime photos to make it look like the women had gotten lost. This included a staged toilet paper / mirror SOS photo. They planted the backpack and the bone fragments when they felt safe to do so, that way people would say, \"Case closed, they got lost in the jungle\" and stop looking for them.",

There's a photo that shows the girls swimming with some local boys in a hot spring, there are several versions about what happened, but it seems that the girls were partying with the gang and the son of the tourist guide wanted Kris to have sex with him, she rejected him and he killed her with a hammer. Lisanne tried to help her only to be murdered too...their bodies were dismembered and burried. When the families offered the reward, the culprits decided to handle the backpack and also claimed that some bones of the girls were accidentally found, however the families decided not to make the payment and instead they donated the money to build a school. The weird photos were taken by the murderers in order to create a story that made the whole thing pass as an accident and the authorities of Panama and the Netherlands took the bait.",

I've been thinking about it and returning to it for a week now and I just can't get it out of my head. My first thoughts to explain how I feel is that it's a 'morbid curiosity'... like the gruesome car-crash you just can't look away from which will end up giving you nightmares. There may be a little of that, but in my mind it is so much more. I actually feel major empathy for these two young girls, especially after reading their diaries and hearing other people describe them. It really is beginning to feel like they were people that I knew personally and it's breaking my heart the more I think of it. I've looked at many gruesome things online and read many stories, but none have affected me the same way. (though the case of Karlie Guse also came close). The photos of these girls last trip didn't feature anything gruesome, but looking at their smiling faces knowing what is about to happen is probably one of the creepiest, scariest and saddest thing I have ever seen... especially once day turns to night and we see all those photos probably taken by a panicked Lisanne which may have just witnessed her best friends death moments ago. Looking at all those call logs to 911/112 as they go from being calm to desperation to hopelessness until finally the phone opens one more time before it shuts off forever. Goodbye Kris and Lisanne. I'm going to have a drink and listen to Lyyke Li- I follow Rivers. I'm sorry that the river you were following didn't lead you two to safety </3",

        "text": "Hey. Late to the party. Here's information:\n\nTwo separate accidents. \n\nOne fell off a cliff; the shots of the night sky are from the ground, the camera pointed up as a beacon. All of the pictures can be overlaid, to show that they are literally all from the same pov, same place, etc. Chances are a sprain, broken leg maybe, but they were more worried about a head wound, that's why there's pictures of her head. Possible concussion, maybe worse. \n\nThe trail they were on, was largely unmarked at the time. It's one where you walk in a direction, get to a place, then walk back. At the time, there was no sign saying OKAY YOURE HERE GO HOME but apparently there is now. I'm guessing they saw something ahead of them, that looked like the next part of the trail they had already been following, and just kept walking.\n\nThe missing photo probably happened because the camera went off at the same time the battery got jostled. It makes a corrupt photo that the camera deletes automatically. I had a similar digital camera, it happens. I also literally have the same samsung s3 phone, until i heard that she accidentally left it on, i was surprised it's battery died first. My one, if you have it fully charged, can keep a charge for over a week. It's only when I use it excessively that the battery drains. \n\nThe other accident came when they tried to cross a monkey bridge. These are notorious for being difficult. They were upstream somewhere, finally found something manmade, and were so SO close to help. \n\nas for the bleached bones, they werent bleached. they were scavenged by fire ants. the excretions from those are very phosphorous, which cleans bones in a similar fashion.\n\nThere's no grand conspiracy here. The ONE thing that was suspicious was their bag turning up. That was probably found by someone, realized it was evidence but didn't wanna get involved.\n\nNo, this was just bad luck. They were smart, they kept to a routine, didn't waste their phone batteries, managed to clear a lot of ground while injured. Honestly, you couldn't hope for better from them. I wish they had just created a big fire or something, but there's no mention of them having matches or a lighter, so they probably couldn't. They were smart, and definitely had endurance. Gorgeous too.",

The clean hair, (with all the rain, moist and sweat, how did it remain clean), the snack left inside the bag (if you are out for days, you wouldve been hungry and mustve eaten the snacks you brought with you right), the deleted photo (thinking of how you would look in a photo would not matter if you are in that situation, unless what you are deleting is an evidence that may be used against you), the clean and dry bag and clothes despite the rain and wet area, also theres no video of them leaving a message to their family of what happened. My own theory is that they went in the jungle with someone (possibly the tourguide or a local) and they were lured to go past the path of where hikers only go. Once they were in the jungle, that is when the person bound them and brought them some place so they can get their organs and sell it. They were possibly killed some place else which explains the clean bag. You also have to be clean before taking your organ out which explains clean hair. All calls made were not from Kris nor Lisanne but the person who has them to make it appear that they were in an accident and they need help. Why no calls were made to their foster home? Why no calls were made to their families? Why dont they know the pass code of each other? Then of course, the authorities needs to cover it up coz it will affect their tourism. \n-thats just what I think happened. If you dont agree, its fine. May they both rest in peace.",

At least three witnesses saw them that day in mid-afternoon coming back from a short hike on another nearby trail \ncalled Piedre de Lino. As mentioned by other locals, walking along the Pianista trail is like walking \nin people's backyard; houses and farms are strewn all along its path and cattle crossing is frequent. Even Kris's parents had to stop and let them pass. It's not a jungle but more a forest. One cannot get lost here for more than a day. \n\nOne must also remember in what condition the Kris's camera was found: in perfect working order inside an almost pristine backpack that supposedly spent two months near or in a river. The two smartphones were also in similar condition. It is also well established that the photos taken from Kris's camera on 01 April were photoshopped. The night photos are of no significance & were added only as a diversion. All this in order to impose the official narrative *Two lost girls dying in the unforgiving jungle*.  Sadly the girls were abducted & murdered. The three or four still living suspects are well known.",

When the attacker finally made his move & decided to pounce, they took one last photograph which captured his image. Aware of this, he took the phone and deleted that image permanently. He scrolled through the rest of the 90 pics and saw he wasn't visible, so continued on with his heinous plan",

They started out clean, because there's mud and dirt on her clothes in later photos, obviously possible from hiking around but, their demeanor changed in later photos as well. Very possible they just got lost and died from exposure. There's also a lot of weird and unusual things surrounding their disappearance. Where they were at, also has a fair amount of traffic, which people who've never been, would think it was  remote and desolate but, it's not as remote as people think. The trail they were on, is commonly traveled and used, especially by tourists. A lot of locals use the trails as well, as it takes you from one side of the peak to the other, which has towns on either side. I could see them taking what they thought was a shortcut and getting lost but, I could also see them running into someone with bad intentions as well.",

I mean if your friend dies then you'd write about it. These women kept journals/diaries so why wouldn't they take a few seconds to type in what happened, especially something so devastating and important, if they actually had their phones? If someone was after them they'd write a description. They left zero information on their phones basically. I mean you want to conserve the battery but there are a few instances where you leave a note, a deathbed confession basically. After all those days of the phones not working I'd expect you'd give up on making calls and just explain what happened and tell your parents you're sorry or whatever. But if you killed two women and wanted them to look as if they were lost in the jungle then I guess you could make it look as if you were trying to be found each day. And if you don't want to lose tourism you're going to say the murder victims were simply hikers that fell. Taking photos to leave a message but not leaving an actual message? I mean why not write in the sand and photograph that? You want to focus on being found but eventually you want people to know why you died.",

Upon their return they had a conversation with a guy who suggested they go to a certain pond, a swimming hole. There is a picture of him on the internet standing over two prone, apparently unconscious girls -- the girls are  both posed exactly the same, hands folded between tucked legs, on their sides, eyes closed -- he stands forefront/over them with a club, or a roughly hewn bat. The picture is taken at the same pond the guy told them to visit. \n\nJust google \"pictures of pond the guy told about in kris kremers and lisanne froon\" and you'll see his pic. Search more and you'll find the two girls pic. \n\nBoth girls' -- Lisanne and Kris-- parents flew to the location and traced their path - it was literally impossible for them to get lost and there was nowhere to fall from. No cliffs, no danger, in fact, you COULDN'T stray from the path. This is according to both sets of parents, eyewitnesses to the nature of that path. And so many people saw her return anyway, so it was after that, when they got back. \n\nI believe the night photos were not taken by the girls, that they were planted to make it look like they'd gotten lost. Note how their faces are never portrayed in the night photos, not once. Because they weren't the ones using the camera at that point in time. \n\nI believe they were lured to the pond by dude and killed, their belongings variously kept/scattered in different locations to further muddy the waters.",

I think something happened to those girls and it started shortly after picture 508 was taken. To be precise just before 16.39 when the first emergency phone call was made (and shortly after second call). No more emergency calls made until 14 hours later. The missing 509 photo which would have been taken during this time. Unusual phone records. The 77 wrong PIN & SIM logins.( Not down to confusion as initially thought, because purposeful actions were taken like swiping the screen and opening the control panel.. So who was trying to use that phone?). Strange photos taken in the night. State of the backpack. No bodies ever recovered apart from a foot and pelvic bone. The different state of decay those bones were in and where they were found (miles away). The Special Forces & local searches that found absolutely nothing. Far too many inconsistencies and unanswered questions. One of the most mysterious cases I've come across in 30 years. Maybe that local guide knows more?",

Ceasar Castillo the climbing instructor, Leonardo Arturo Gonzalez, Osman Valenzuela, Jorge Rivera Miranda, Jose Manuel Murgas all killed shortly after, Eileen Witek returning to Germany shortly after. \n\nLorenzo Gonzalez hearing screams and warning 2 French tourists 2nd of April, the day after Lisanne and Kris disappears. Feliciano Gonzalez being the tour guide with the key to the room who go inside their room after they disappear and first contact authorities 5 hours later, and who has a ranch and family farm by the trail where the remains of the girls are found, Henry Eliezer Gonzalez being the son being drunk, speaking of a \"run in\" he had with the girls at the pharmacy, hence the deleted CCTV footage, being known to be interested in foreign women, a smooth talker and being associated Plinio Montenegro driver for \"Mamallena\" youth hostel.  Henry Eliezer Gonzalez, Osman Valenzuela and Jose Manuel Murgas all being members of a youth gang, with Osman and Jose being killed shortly after.\n\nNotice how so many die, so many involved with a gang and the trail, so much suggesting the trail is not hard and would not have ways of it, and that the girls returned, and the survivers are the Gonzalez'es who obviously has power in the area with land, with both Feliciano, Henry Eliezer and Lorenzo being involved, and likely Miriam Guerra and Eileen Witek helping to give them power to cover up. I think the 3 Gonzalez'es look extremely suspicious. Especially Henry Eliezer and Feliciano. Likely Lorenzo tipped off the French to cover up for his family and give them time, the government did too, to get tourist money. \n\nAlso the evidence was clearly tampered with. The picture of Lisette is clearly photoshopped, you can see how one of her boobs \"magically\" looks much bigger on one of the trail pics, and Kris being alone on the later photos and the evidence which seems to have been planted, suggest foul play, with many potentially helping to cover up for government money and because they are connected with the Gonzalez'es. Jorge Rivera Miranda who worked at the pharmacy also being killed, and could have been involved with cover up about medicine needed for Lisette which could explain her being out of the pictures earlier.\n\nI would really like to know Henry Eliezer and Feliciano's alibi, and also what excuse they and Miriam had for having a key to the girls room and going in their room and waiting to contact authorities 5 hours, and what excuse Henry Eliezer Gonzalez and Jorge Rivera Miranda has for the deleted CCTV footage. I think the dead people all was either accomplishes or had evidence, and I think all 3 Gonzalezes know a lot more than they say, and likely Miriam Guerra and Eileen Witek does too.\n\nI don't think the girls died on the trail. The neatly folded back pack and body remains makes no sense for that. I think it was all planted on purpose and the pictures and phones tampered with.\nMy guess is that the girls got into the wrong car and went somewhere else where they were likely raped and killed, and then the evidence planted later as a cover up.",

I always thought it was something suspicious not just starvation or dehydration that killed them... but I can see how people think this.\n\nIt's possible that the photos were taken as evidence so that when someone found their camera, they were able to back track and see where Kris's body was left.\n\nBUT, one of the main reasons I don't believe this is because it would have been so much easier to video tape what was happening to them... Blair Witch style. Why would you take a ton of photos when you can record yourself for one minute and explain that you were lost and injured? There wouldn't be any confusion with that.",

She is letting ppl know the one girl fell trying to cross over the cables over the water. That's what those marker red flags were. She has one pointing at where she starting trying to cross and then the other points toward the cable. That cable broke. \nEdited. I went back and looked again. No , the cable did not break, it was still up when officials got there, so she must have fallen off. This is why the surviving girl took that photo of the injury. She wanted to let the other girl's family know what happened..which means by this time she was aware she was not going to make it out of that jungle alive because if she thought she was going to make it, she wouldn't have given those photos so much thought. Those photos were very well thought out.",

        "text": "I’m definitely torn on this one. There are some odd pieces about this case that make it confusing to determine foul play vs. natural death. My theory:\n\nThe girls had no plans for the day they went missing so they decided to go check out the trail. Maybe they really enjoyed hiking and wouldn’t mind doing that two days in a row, or they figured if it was a simple hike they could cancel the following day’s scheduled hike and do something else. I’ve taken many vacations and this seems very likely. They could have got lost looking for the dog if he ran off..which is why the dog made it back home that night but the girls got lost further off the trail. The one girl most likely fell off the monkey bridge and into the water below..she died from the fall and that’s why after decomposition her foot was severed from her leg and still in her boot. Animals got to her and that explains the somewhat scattered bones. The second girl tried to phone emergency services multiple times and tried to make it as long as she could alone in the wild by herself, but she eventually died herself from starvation, dehydration, and the elements. \n\nHowever, a few things to question and note: \n1. The camera’s random 90 photos were taken 10 days after their disappearance, and found 10 weeks after that. 87 of the 90 photos were black, and only three showed the environment. Did the one girl not know the lense was on? Did she try to use it to see where she was going but was disoriented from 10 days of being lost and dying? \n\n2. Why were the one girl’s bones bleached? Is there a natural explanation for this that hasn’t been discussed? It’s very confusing. \n\n3. There are rumors that their taxi driver that day was also found dead months later. Coincidence or another factor in this case? \n\n4. It’s odd to me that they would just keep going further into unknown forest..the trail they began on was popular with both tourists and locals..it’s odd that NO one on the trails would have seen or heard them in all of those 10 days. It could have been must easier for them to find some indication of where they were in the daylight. \n\nReally odd but I don’t necessarily get a murder vibe from this one..but more likely a sad tragic series of events being lost and stranded in the foreign forest.",

        "text": "I think the vast majority of evidence leads to them getting lost. The night photos taken on the 8th was the first night that the search group stayed in the jungle. I don't think this was a coincidence, i believe the girls perhaps noticed some light in the distance where the searchers were camped and tried to draw attention with the cameras flash. Expert analysis of the photos has determined that most of them can be overlayed to create a composite which shows that the camera was being pointed towards a specific direction. I'm guessing in the direction of the rescue searchers camp. Once i discovered that information, i had less doubt that they simply got lost. I find it very unlikely that a third party would sit in the jungle and take dozens of photos over the course of hours at a specific spot in the distance to fabricate some kind of evidence to throw of the investigators. It should also be mentioned that most of the photos in their RAW state, appeared black. It was only after the investigators adjusted the brightness on a computer that the images could be made out. This also helps to debunk a third party taking photos theory because they wouldn't have known what images they were capturing, to them it would just be black image after black image. Hardly something you would use as fake evidence.",

The claim that it was found clean seems to stem from a misinterpreted article.\n2) People have recreated the same camera model skipping a photo number by deleting it directly on the camera, by having it fall, or having it sustain water damage.\n\nI think they either got lost or slipped and got injured or somehow immobilized. The \"suspicious\" stuff actually convinces me that foul play didn't happen. Manually deleting photos, faking 112 calls, scattering body parts in the jungle, etc. Seems like an insane amount of effort and risk when it would be much easier and safer to make sure that bag and those bodies were never found.",

        "text": "After watching The island with bear grylls which coincidentally was filmed in panama I think the most logical explanation is that they got lost. If you Google el mirador del pianista boquete panamá you can find multiple traveler photos of the trail. At the time they went on the trail there weren’t any signs or markers to indicate that the trail had ended. The girls didn’t speak Spanish and they weren’t from the area. The trail doesn’t have signs or a post that indicate which way back to town. After exploring beyond the mirador for close to 3 hours, the girls panicked when they realized they were going in circles and it was getting dark soon. \n\nThe jungle is pitch dark and there are tons of predators which include snakes, spiders, jaguars, cougars, coyotes. Plus reports at the time indicated that rain had slowed down the rescue efforts. My best guess is they tried to climb to high ground in order to get a cellular signal. \n\nThe night pictures showed what appears to look like S.O.S sign with white paper. The camera appears to have been used as a flashlight as there was proof of pictures taken with flash every 9 seconds standing in the same spot. The night pictures also indicate they were on high ground overlooking a steep drop below. \n\nAt some point it appears they tried to follow the culebra river until they reached a town. Unfortunately the culebra river runs to the Caribbean side which would take them farther away from boquete. \n\nI don’t believe that they were killed by a gang of local boys that followed them into the jungle because it would be easier to dig a grave and bury the girls and all their belongings and ensure they vanished without a trace instead of turning phone off and on 77 times on several days and taking 100’s of photos in order to make it appear the girls were lost in the jungle. Lastly, it doesn’t make sense to fold all the girls belongings and put camera in waterproof bag so that someone can find it later.",

It makes more sense than if an assailant was trying to enter the phone. If I was an assailant, I would not waste my time trying to figure out a password of a stranger. If I was a friend though, I may feel that i know enough about my friend to guess their password. The friend may have felt she had a chance by trying middle names, pet names, birthdates, etc. To me, trying to find a password 77 times is something her friend would try rather than an attacker. Also, I believe the photos could've been taken by the friend. On my phone, there are two options you can click before logging in. They are 1) take a photo 2) emergency calls. The two icons are right next to eachother. I think it's plausible that while she was trying to use the call button, or just desperately trying to unlock the phone by clicking a bunch of buttons, that a few accidently pictures could be taken.",

Phones data and photos maybe were tampered..some witness may lie or wrong...but NOT all witness lie or wrong..its imposible. So I go with this timeline , in wich witness saw them get out a taxi in the aftermoon at the start of Pianista or near that  (no with official dates that stay they started  pianista hike at 11am according to phonelogs).Also believe some witness mess with 31 and 1st....So my shoot is:\n\nMarch 31:  went to walk around Boquete and probably went to Av. Buenos Aires / casa Pedro just at the start of Pianista or Lino ( 1 km each other), they went just to the start of Pianista, with a taxi, bus? \n18 pm went to Si grid for massage with a wasap message. \n\n- april 1: Left school at 13pm\narrive with taxi at the start  with G.M around 13:40 pm...( some witness saw them )...started hike at around 14pm(still reception..)... then we have 508 ( around 16:30pm)..first stream photo ; (in presence with other people??), i think at this point they wanted return to Boquete...but something suddenly happened like an attack or something violent ,and strong believe  F son ( alive) and some of his gang- friends,Murg as, Os man,  Miran da..Leon ardo etc, ( all dead or missing same with Aguirre..and Adonis in prison) were in complot and carried them past the continental divide...that's the reason they never found them in that first two days\nÍ dont think photos were with photoshop..just rezise and messed with times.\n\nQuestions:\nMarch 31:went to Av buenos Aires...to Lino trail and come back at 15-30\" , Or Pianista trail ( officially no phone activity between 14pm -17pm). If they went why are no public pics of 31? Pics deleted ? Or dates altered?\n- Last wifi contact 16:44 in Spanish by the River?\n- Pedro saw them 31 or 1st?\n-on 1st taxi driver ( G.M, with two guys?) dropped them off around 13:40pm or really 10:30am?\n- 1st.wifi connection at 11 am on Pianista restaurant? Or 10:10 at Nelvis or Spanish school?\n- first call emergencys are from them?\nThat trail is full of people and sheds..how the hell nobody saw them? Or some locals saw something and wanted to be blind?\n-Why fincas in alto romero were not checked?\n-lifted at the start of Pianista by a car/truck and went swimming? \n-Or went swimming before start the trail? For me if it happens was at 31 , but who knows..they didn't say nothing on theirs diaries...but being honest ..i imagine KK not whanting register this thing for obvious reasons..personally i dont believed where them in that pic.\n-What about net providers? ( this can tell us were that day based on their phone locations)\n- kris Boyfriend call Kk at 14pm?  So how no more mobile reception at 13:38pm? They switch off their phones around 13:38 / 14pm?\n-Someone called them later on 1st and next days??\n- some pics on Pianista on 1st with photoshop? And out of order?\n-digital camera times and date altered?\n-what about german tourist on april 5th at Quetza trail claimed that that the girls had been beaten and thrown down a ravine? Or french tourist on 6th on Quetza trail who heard screams from two girls, then a loud crash and three guys on that trail?\n- if they were abducted and led to an abandoned cabin/shack.. how is the dogs didn't sense something?\n-are bones planted from them?\n-Why later troubles at Osman funeral ?\n-what really happened to Lee Zelteer,  he found the truth before die or killed? Readed that he saw in the deep web how they were beaten  ..but i dont believed it..\n\nOther options\n- they returned from Lino trail and both sat on the side of the road to go back to Boquete around  15pm and witness saw them turn a corner..why go to Pianista if they were tired and L sickly????\nGap here Oliva saw them walk at 16pm and Martina another witness saw them get into a car...another gap Lorenzo a guide saw them ascended the pianist...\nThere is few information about this...\n- or after 508 the ran afraid of some people and both fall and had an accident and captured them..i dont believe this thing about run in the jungle would let them send some message to the familes .\n- or they went to the start of Pianista twice and thats why mess with dates and witness timelines..so if they went morning why take photos again?\n-One priv investigator who went to Panama conclude they went to Tree Park and here worked and of H.G  friends and things went out of control and killed them\n- they went the same day twice to Pianista..\n- they went 31 afternoon to Pianista trail( sunny day).agressor changed  date on cameras (easy to do)...next day ( cloudy)went to another place probably near to avenida Buenos Aires and lifted by a car. \n\nFacts:\n-9 people died in strange circunstances involved in this case\n- investigation was a total disaster and closed quickly for protect tourism.\n- a lot of DNA and fingertips on their remains.\n-phone logs flawed\n-In all options foul play or third party involved, using the common sense imposible to survive more than ten days lost and not sent a single text( neither unsent) or a video.\n-3rd party was behind these phone calls.\n-F lied about meeting the girls and protected his son.\n-Bones planted\n- not all photos were shared to the public\nMy great gap is where was 508 pic..i have my doubt with official set that was like \" passing\" the continental divide..\n\nStrange actitudes and things:\nLanguage School and Aura\nI.L( who cancelled the volunteer work) and went later to Costa Rica\n- assistant hotel manager E.W who went to the speed of light to Germany\n-host family( M.G) ( spent 30 minutes in the girls room with F)\n\nJustice for KK & L!",

        "text": "There is a 3d model expert who worked in forensics that specifically worked on time of day analysis. He got the coordinates of the sun on the 1st of April and their local coordinates of the photo location at the summit. Also he used directions Lisanne was facing in the photos and used 3d modeling and lighting to determine the time the photos could have been taken and he concluded around 1pm. He showed how shadowing would have looked at 2, 3 and 4pm as well as before 1pm and suggested the time had to be near 1pm.\n     That matches the camera meta data. I think witnesses are often mistaken and it happens a lot in cases. People don't always look at the clock to determine in memory events. I think the meta data is correct that they reached the summit at 1pm and were dropped off around 11am by the Taxi.",

Happy joyful photo's of both girls at the sommet of the mountain on the first of april. After that date, not one photo was taken of them, apart from that weird picture of Kris' hair in which no one can tell if Kris is still alive at that point. Their phones had not one message or picture on it to say their goodbyes to the families nor to indicate they were in a very dangerous situation. Only a few bones are found from the victims when the human body counts 206 bones. Their backpack, non-weather proof was found 2 months later after their disappearance in a dense and moist jungle, and it was stated that the backpack was clean and in pristine condition still holding their phones and a camera all in working conditions together with both girls bra's neatly folded in it. DNA results from the backpack were lost during this case by the police as well as certain witness testimonies that were simply discarded or ignored. Searching for weeks into the area and nothing gets found until a pelvic bone, a rib and a foot was found and even much later a piece of rolled up skin and a shin bone both belonging to the girls but all in a different state of decomposition and some of them even showing traces of chemicals. FYI skin is known to be one of the human organs to decompose  as first. After just stating only a few of the things that would make one wonder ... it doesn't take a Sherlock to know that this case stinks beyond measure. As more as you read about this case the clearer it becomes those girls were murdered.",

These men made sure the girls were deep in the area before approaching the girls. These men acted friendly at first, but the girls were worried. One guy said, 'hey, I'll take your photo'. That's the photo where the girl looked worried. Then the men said to the girls, 'take our photo'. That's the photo that was deleted later by the men. Sadly, the girls were perhaps raped and murdered. Possibly chopped up by the men to try and make it look like an animal had eaten and dissected the bodies. The photos and phone call attempts were made by the men. Again, to try to make it look like a real distress call. And the photo of the girl's hair/head was after she had been killed.",

It cannot have any meaning if it was taken at 1:49 and the next one of the sky follows immediately at 1:50. If it was supposed to show something, there would have been another photo at daylight. Also, Kris cannot have held then because there was not time. The photo before that was from 1:45. She would have had to get up in darkness, hold Lisanne, take the photo and then immediately go back to shooting the surroundings while still holding Lisanne then the whole time. Makes no sense.",

        "text": "I keep coming back to this case. I cant seem to get over the mystery. There are other photos online that allegedly show them swimming with 1 or 2 local 20s aged males in a river. The fact that they went on their hike a day before their scheduled tour leads me to believe that someone (possibly the men from the photos) said they knew the area and offered to take them themselves or himself. Its likely that this was foul play and nothing was stolen because it was driven by an attempted kidnapping for ransom or (and i know this sounds messed up) the girls refused these mens sexual advances and it turned violent. Its possible when running away they were seperated from their belongings and the attacker was attempting to delete any photos or texts from himself that were on one of the girls phones. (It doesnt make sense why he wouldnt just destroy the phone) they also could have been abducted and killed and returned to the scene later with belongings planted in a very careful attempt to insure plausibility of the \"lost in the jungle\" story. I dont know of what ive heard online is true but apparently the men in these photos suffered unnatural deaths in the weeks following the search. Its just hard to understand why they would get so lost because everyone says its a very public trail and if they were out for days they would have crossed someone.\n\nAnd looking at reviews from the trail. Other says it is poorly marked, cloudy, rainy, and lots of flash flood washouts. They could have continued down the wrong trail but it still kinda of leads to foul play because of the phone attempts. the state of the belongings and the timing between 911 calls and ofcourse the night photos. one of which had the girls hair in it. The bleached bones too. Theres also reports of some weird humam sacrifice mumbo jumbo in thr area.\n\nAll in all it doesnt make sense why they went so far down river and down hill intentionally. Looking at the elevation on google maps  and the photos the girls took you would probably assume to turn back you would go back UP the trail. Maybe one was injured and the other didnt want to leave her alone and went out with her friend like a boss. None the less, the whole things horrible and i wish it never happened.",

        "text": "Brilliant analysis! Extremely interesting interpretation of awkward evidence such as the pattern in the emergency calls. In a comment I have posted elsewhere I sketch an explanation of the change in the girls photo documentation pattern after photo 508 on the simple basis that after this photo they just turned back and started descending the trail. Therefore no more photos were needed since the locations had been documented on their way up. The time frame of them turning back after 508 fits perfectly with the time of day they would want to return from the trail before it gets dark (arrival at the root of the trail at 4:30pm the latest, when sun sets at 6:30pm on April 1st) and fits with first emergency calls being made shortly after arriving at the start of the path. I think it would be worth considering whether the girls had pre arranged to be picked up by taxi or the guys off road vehicle at the start of the trail around the time they intended to return ( 3:30ish to 4:30ish)... A pre arranged vehicle would make sense as the signal in the jungle was bad. This pre arrangement would have given the predators time to prepare the actual foul play plan. Your explanation about the first two emergency calls is brilliant and we can picture ourselves doing the same in an odd though as yet not threatening situation. They way you bring in the narrative the various protagonists, their motives and participation is ingenious just as the way you explain why the emergency calls throughout had this quirky pattern. Amazing job!! But, how do you explain the photos in the jungle and particularly the one with Cris hair???? If taken by the perpetrators during the move to the cave, why was the picture with Cris hair was taken? And do you think she was alive at the time? There's sth in the way the look of the hair almost defeats gravity that emits a sense it was taken when Cris was not in life anymore. Would love to see more from you on this case!!!",

They fell for about 1 more hour until they reached the first ravine with a watercourse, there you can see Kris posing on a rock. That is the last normal photo taken. Then came the night photos. Lisanne had downloaded an offline map from Google Maps that she closed at the viewpoint. There are stories that they had information about some waterfalls they wanted to reach. Following the path after the watercourse in which the last normal photo was, you reach another more intense watercourse with a waterfall, I think that's where they wanted to go.",

Pourquoi la remettre dans l'appareil? Pour éviter des soupçons? Effacer les preuves complètement est plus plausible comme avenue selon moi.\n\nDonc au final, je me demande s'il n'y aurait pas eu en effet un \"glitch\" ou bogue avec la caméra pour expliquer cette absence, probablement en effaçant une image directement dans la caméra.\n\nÉtant très connaissant dans le domaine de la photographie (j'ai fait plusieurs contrats professionnels mais ça n'a jamais été mon métier principal), j'ai régulièrement été prévenu par des collègues professionnels de ne jamais effacer une photo directement dans la caméra. De toujours attendre que la carte SD soit dans l'ordinateur pour le faire. \nLa raison étant le risque accru de corruption des fichiers. Ça ne m'est jamais arrivé mais quand on lit sur le sujet ça semble être vrai et bien réel comme risque. Donc je reste perplexe à considérer ce fait comme preuve indéniable de manipulation par un tiers. Possible, mais pas 100% certain.\n\nJ'ai déjà supprimé par erreur des photos et j'ai utilisé le logiciel fourni par la compagnie de la carte SD et dans certains cas j'ai pu retrouver la ou les photos supprimées par erreur. \n\nPar contre je me demande si une fois la carte formatée, si ce genre de logiciel est encore capable de retrouver des images perdues... \nDonc en effet pour faire disparaître définitivement UNE seule photo volontairement, soit il y a une façon spéciale comme supposé dans l'analyse ici, ou bien c'est un simple glitch technique. Mystère!",

        "text": "Here is what I have concluded based on the known evidence and my own investigation of this tragic matter.\n\n1. That area has wildlife and woods but it's not the amazon folks. There are farms  nearby that path, pasture,  etc. They did not get lost.  \n2. I reject the idea that the two were eaten or killed by wild animals even though Panama does have jaguars. I base this conclusion on the fact that the dog on loan to them returned to its original owner . Any predator animal would have killed the dog defending them , first.  \n3. There are Fincas in the area. Based on the night photos, I do believe the women were being stalked.  Perhaps they thought if thry took photos in the direction of the sounds made by the person or persons following them, he would flee . \nIt is possible there existed a photo of the murderer (s) which was deleted  by the culprits.\n4. The persons of interest should be, in no particular order,  the jilted Guide, someone who lives on or owns one of the nearby Finca houses  who might have encountered them and invited them over gorgeous a meal or guarroom or lemon ade.\n5. I do not believe the photo of the head of  blond hair belongs to either woman. It might not be that of a woman. Why take such a photo? \n6. Given the placement of the various body  parts  and the fact money  ( some of it) was found along with the cell phones and camera and other items , I believe these were \" arranged \". \n7. At some weeks after their death,  the animals did eventually come to the various locations to eat them as the foot found in one boot may indicate. \n8. This was made to look like the two got lost by the culprits who fid them in. \n9.  Notice, I say culprits,  plural, but it was only 1 man if the killer had both at gunpoint . \n10. A man or a small group of 2 -3 men may have been rejected by the 2 women whereupon they were murdered.  This was not a simple\n robbery unless it had gone terribly wrong. \n11.The police should visit every Finca and work hand in the area . They may have been invited to get a bite to eat only to discover once inside that they were going to be robbed or sexualay assaulted or sadistically killed. \nNot an accident.  Not lost and starved to death. Not attacked by wild animals. They either met up with a Panamanian they recognized from a prior encounter who stalked them or ...someone along the famous path how lived nearby murdered them in cold blood and then took great pains to make it look like  it was not a robbery,  not a sexual assault, and/ or  not a murder. \n\nThe dog returned .There has to be a reason why she took a photo  picture of a person with blond hair. \n\nHope this helps your investigation.",

Could be an accident but I doubt it, because like the investigator said, they would have recorded it, somehow. I think after the last \"nice photo\", the possible crime occured (kidnapping, murder etc). \n\nI always wondered about the photo of the hair, wich looks good and clean, what about it ? When was it taken, why does it still look so good if the have allegedly been a week in this rainforest... ?\n\nAnd what about this photo where they pose with boys in the water, when was this taken ? Is it true that these 2 boys are dead by now ?\n\nAfter all the informations I got today (I'm new to this case), I think there definitely happened a crime there, and we may never know by whom and why... Sad story anyway.\nIn France we had a case wich still remains unsolved after many decades, the death of 4 year old Gregory, wich was drowned in a river possibly by family members, but we never got to find out for sure.

I've gone hiking before in that area during a school trip and I know how the terrain of Panama's mountains are. you can see trees in the distance standing upright and the foliage goes upright theres no foliage that hangs straight.\n\nAlso, every single rocky area like that in the mountains is bound to be full of mud and moss. My guess is that they tried to climb down, slipped, and fell. The bodies were likely torn apart by animals. The last picture taken could've been a picture they didn't like before they figured out that they were lost and panicked.\n\nGuys, if you ever visit Panama, whether you're hiking or not, bring a capable tour guide with you. It's a dangerous place and the police are infamous for doing jack shit about even the most heinous of crimes.",

It seems more like it has been taken somewhere on the beach and photoshopped later. And it has also been stated that the picture where Kris looks back while standing on the stones.. She looks concerned and worried. Its possible they have already been stalked or accomplied by someone they didn't want. Someone who took the photo for them to make it seem normal? I am suspecting that tour guide... There's lots of fake reviewa on tripadvisor and one woman even wrote that she felt very uncomfortable in his presence. That the old man was very into young european woman and that he even joked about chopping her leg off with his machete.\n\nI am sad these things weren't mentioned in the video 😢😥",

I understand some bones were separated. What body parts/sections were found intact? In what position? And were skulls found? Could they have detected any chemical/artificial bleaching through testing? The mere question surrounding photo 509 establishes foul play. Photo 509 could only have been deleted manually with a computer that had specialized software. Ergo, either the perp(s) happened to have a charged laptop with this software on their person; or, the memory card was taken, the photo deleted, and the card returned to the camera in the backpack in the jungle; or, the photo was deleted after discovery. Deletion after discovery seems the most probable. Especially when you consider the fact that they framed what is clearly probable homicide as nothing more than a tragic drowning accident. If they can unabashedly claim that an apple is a banana, then they can certainly stoop to deleting an unfavorable photo. Great coverage!",

        "text": "THIS IS MY EXPLANATION. Tell me what you think:\n\n1) The girls leave the trail and get lost.\n2) Some local notices that the two girls are lost. Someone starts following them with bad intentions (Organ trafficking? Mere Violence? It doesn't matter)\n3) The girls get more and more lost deep into the jungle.\n4) The girls fall and injure themselves (one or both doesn't matter). The bad guy (or guys) gets closer.\n5) At night, the girls take photos hoping to be spotted perhaps by an airplane. They start realizing someone is following them. They hear a sound in the forest. They shoot a picture to light the forest: in THIS PHOTO the bad guy is distinguishable (but the girls DON'T SEE HIM in the moment). They keep taking pictures hoping to attract attention (33 photos taken at 2 minutes intervals!)\n6) The assailant decides to attack, kills the girls, and takes their backpack.\n7) The assailant dismembers the bodies and scatters them (maybe as he did several times in the past)\n\n— Important: The assailant does not sell the tourists' belongings nor exchange or use the girls' $83. This would have raised suspicions.\n\nBUT HERE COMES THE TWIST!\n\n8) The international search begins. The $30,000 REWARD is announced. This attracts the bad guy's attention. The girls backpack could be the way to get the reward.\n9) The bad guy checks the camera SD card. He FINDS THE PHOTO in which he is visible and he decides to delete that photo. Then he arranges the unexpected discovery of the backpack (probably in agreement with whoever would have found it and thus collected the reward. That was the plan!).\n10) The backpack is found perfectly preserved (but with THE PHOTO missing). \n\n— Additionally, the 3 guys who died accidentally in the following year were potential witnesses or accomplices.\n\nEverything seems to perfectly match. No mysteries.\nWhat do you think?\n\nBTW: in this documentary they managed to interview the girl who found the backpack. She complained about the fact that she found the backpack but her family didn't receive any reward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA430_4VJ_Y",

        "text": "Points that contradict the theory that they just got lost:\r\n\r\n1) the backpack -- it was found 70 days after the girls' disappearance, beside a river bank 15 km away from the pianista trail. The lady who found it said she was at the same spot the day before but didn't see any backpack there. The backpack was NOT wet -- it was in pristine condition and the items inside were dry and appeared untouched. The phones and digital camera were in there, so it becomes difficult to see how the girls could've been the ones taking the pictures and calling emergency services in the jungle for 11 days, and yet the backpack doesn't get wet or dirty, and somehow makes a long journey on its own without getting wet. \r\n\r\n2) Lisanne's severed left foot was found in her hiking boot, and the cut was clean -- This disproves any animal attack theory and shows a human being cut off her foot. Unless Pokemon are real and a Scyther jumped out and cut her foot off, then it was a human. It can't be argued that an animal could have done that, plus the boot was clean and still tied to her foot, with no sign of scratches or claw marks\r\n\r\nHonestly, I don't see how anyone can believe they just got lost given the above 2 points. Ok let's tack on some more for goal differential :P\r\n\r\n3) Pictures -- I'm hoping people have watched/read other things about this case, to gather more details. The daytime pictures and nighttime pictures tell completely different (albeit incomplete) stories. \r\n\r\nTimeline: they start their hike on April 1st. Yikes, I didn't even notice that was April Fool's, ugh. \r\n\r\n-> daytime pictures - The girls are smiling. These are the ones at the foot of the trail, along it and leading up to them reaching the peak where I wish they had been able to turn back. In the strange pictures of Kris beside the stream of water and crouched by the bushes, she's not smiling at all and some believe at this point they were either kidnapped or had run into another group and knew they were dangerous.\r\n\r\n These initial pictures were taken before 1:30-2:00pm, so that refutes the taxi driver saying he dropped them off at that time. Nope, he might've just misremembered but this notion that they started their hike at 2pm is simply false. MORE on that taxi driver in a bit ....\r\n\r\n> nighttime pictures - After 2pm on April 1st, no one used the camera for 7 days. It just doesn't make sense, if they were alone and simply lost, to not have a SINGLE picture of them, or anything in the daytime for that matter. But then on April 8th, someone took more than 90 photos in less than 3 hours - those hours were between 1am-4am. This is where the \"they just got lost\" camp suggests that these photos were meant to light up the area so they could see their surroundings, perhaps signal an airplane or search party, or perhaps scare off an animal they (or rather just she, by this point) might have heard. I have to admit, whyy would kidnappers be out at 1-4am taking pictures though? Best chance to not be seen as they make it look like the girls took the pictures in the jungle? Oh, I dunno. But then again, WHY was there 0 camera activity for 7 days?\r\n\r\nThen there's the deleted photo and this one's a mammoth. Keep in mind that pictures were taken on a digital camera, not their phones. A computer must be used to fully erase a photo, and the Canon company itself confirmed this. It makes a strong argument that the girls managed to get a picture of something or someone incriminating, and whoever kidnapped them (* cough Feliciano Gonzales) had to have deleted the picture. \r\n\r\n4) Phones -- alright so on the first day, April 1st, the first emergency call to 112 was placed just after 4:30pm. Then a call was placed to 911 but didn't get through. Then phones turned off for 14 hours. Again, why? If they were lost and had their phones, how do they both go 14 hours without having their phone on? \r\n\r\nIn total, they made about 80 calls. On day 5 (April 5th) LIsanne's phone died. Kris's phone stayed on until day 11 but between April 7th-10th Kris's phone was off/had no activity. It was turned on again, for the last time, at 10:51am on April 11th. It was turned off exactly an hour later at 11:51am, and this was the end of any phone activity. \r\n\r\nOn April 6th, there were several attempts to enter an incorrect code. There were dozens of attempts up until April 11th. The girls obviously would have exchanged pass codes so it's very unlikely that Lisanne would've been locked out of Kris's phone. Plus, they didn't need a pass code to make an emergency call so investigators concluded it was unlikely to have been Lisanne trying to enter the code. The girls hadn't called home or the place they were staying, or anything other than emergency services in those 11 days so that seemed a bit strange. Why \"dozens\" of attempts to enter a phone, unless it was kidnappers looking for photos or something before they plant the phones in the backpack and leave them by the river. \r\n\r\n5) Tour guide / gang members \r\nOh I gotta wrap this up. No one's reading anyway but I can't sleep so let's write until the eyes get heavy haha. Okay but yeah, let's go over some of these characters.\r\n\r\nFeliciano Gonzales - the tour guide\r\nInternet sleuths like me believe he's our guy. He basically IS a red flag, everything that he does. The girls were supposed to meet with Feliciano but they didn't. So after the girls went missing, he went over to the place they were staying and was in the girls' room for 30 minutes. There wasn't a door key in the backpack that was found, which doesn't make sense. Then of course it's Feliciano who spotted the boot with Lisanne's severed foot in it, and other bones. 33 bones were discovered, one pair of jean shorts, and one shoe from each of the girls. Then there was a rolled up ball of human skin. Then you look at Feliciano's tripadvisor reviews online and the one where he threatens a woman with a machete sticks out. Machete, clean cut above the ankle, hmm. OH, and then the suspicious deaths. Over 10 people connected to the case have died, including 4 member of the Los gang. The one gang member who survived? Henri Elizas Gonzales, Feliciano's son. Alright. \r\n\r\nTaxi driver -- named Leonardo Gonzales -- drove the girls to la pianista, told police he saw a pickup truck near where he dropped the girls off. He was found dead in a river, 7 months after the girls' disappearance.\r\n\r\nGang member 1 - Osman Velezuales (23 years old) - died April 4th (3 days after the girls' disappearance). \r\n\r\n2 - Juan Rivera Miranda (24)\r\n3 - Jorge Murgas (23)\r\n4 - Adonis Henriberto (23)\r\n\r\nOne was drowned in a shallow pool, one hit and run, and I forget the other. I'm tired, still need to look up another supposed suspect named Plineo Montenegro. \r\n\r\nBut yeah, again no one will have read this but forgive the long rant, anyway. This case just has so many strange elements to it. I mean, the girls actually had a compass, a solar power bank, and a knife in their room. They obviously would've taken these if they planned to go on a long hike, which further makes me believe they were intercepted at some point on the trail. \r\n\r\nIt just seems obvious that there was foul play involved. Foul play's a euphemism for what Lisanne and Kris went through, and I can't see any way they just got lost. Again they didn't pack much, they didn't take any daytime photos after the first 2 hours of their hike, the condition of the bone fragments, the knowledge of gang/police/government corruption in Panama, all of it. If they were lost, wouldn't they have tried to mark where they've been? It's dense jungle but even little pieces of clothing tied to a tree could be seen by people searching. What about trying to make SOS signs out of rocks or sticks?> Or at least make piles of random sticks and brush so you'll know you've been there before, and people searching can tell a human made those piles. \r\n\r\nI dunno, it just seems a bit disrespectful to the girls and their lives to believe they were foolish and got lost. Just think, if Lisanne or Kris was your daughter, would you be able to look at this case and accept that the girls must've just got lost? Evidence for them being lost pales in comparison to them being kidnapped, does it not?\r\n\r\nThen again, I could be wrong :)",

        "text": "This video should not be so quick to wildly speculate about foul play. There is simply no evidence of it. The \"incorrect pin attempts\" (if that happened at all) could be the result of Lisanne trying desperately to guess Kris's pin OR it could be the result of the effects of exposure and starvation. (Note: other human beings in similar circumstances have been known to get simple things wrong, such as writing the wrong date in their journal.) It's also unclear if they were trying to unlock the phone and putting in wrong numbers or simply checking the signal!\n\nSecondly, if they eventually fell and/or drowned in a river, their bodies would rapidly start to decompose which in the right conditions can cause the body to break apart. It's very common for the feet of people who drown in rivers or other moving water to detach from the body cleanly at the ankle. The Salish Sea human foot discoveries are perfect examples of this - from Wikipedia, \"Decomposition may separate the foot from the body because the ankle is relatively weak, while buoyancy caused by air either inside or trapped within a shoe would allow it to float away. The B.C. Coroners Service never found cut marks on any bones that suggest the feet were severed from the bodies.\" Lisanne's foot found detached in this way doesn't raise more questions; it clearly answers the question of where her body was when it began to decompose - the river.\n\nThirdly, the DNA found on the bag could have found its way onto the bag at any point leading up to hike, and it is very reasonable to assume that it would be difficult to get any meaningful DNA from such an item (which wasn't clean when it was found; that's simply incorrect). We know, for example as per this video, that they were volunteering at a school. That DNA could have been from any number of adults or children who came into contact with them leading up to this day.\n\nFourthly, what evidence is there that the bleaching was unnatural? What evidence is there to prove it would have taken too long naturally in this area in this time of year? To what extent is the bone bleached? The fact the bleaching is discussed at such a high level indicates this script was written by someone without the right expertise or willingness to seek it out.\n\nFifthly, the picture of the hair is over exposed, that is all, just like most of the other photos shared in this video.\n\nFinally (god so many things...), in what universe do you need a computer to delete a single photo on a digital camera? Perhaps the woman taking the photos was simply upset at the photo they took. Maybe the other woman was dead or unwell and the photographer didn't want to see the photo anymore. It could have been any reason. OR it was simply a damaged SD card from water exposure.\n\nSo many people wanting to find a murderer in this small place when the story is about the locals doing what they could to find these women alive.",

Artefact qui apparaissent flous car trop près de l'objectif ou en mouvement. Souvent des poussières, du pollen, insectes (c'est la jungle) ou comme dit dans la vidéo des gouttes de pluie ou ruissellement.. Ces photos s'expliquent assez aisément (Le rasoir d'Ockam est toujours une précaution nécessaire).\n\nPoint plus problématique où je serai curieux de voir CE modèle d'appareil et les réglages possibles.\nÇa pourrait expliquer la présence d'une fonction de nommage/numérotation des photos. Certaines applications donnent des numéros de sauvegardes à l'intérieur du fichier (exif) et( se sert de ce numéro pour nommer. Ainsi, sur ces applications, on peut faire 3 sauvegardes (appelées 01, 02 et 03), les effacer, et les sauvegardes suivantes se nommeront pourtant 04, etc. et non 01.\nMais ça c'est surement un truc logiciel, il faudrait voir comment était configuré l'appareil.\n\nMais il y a un plus gros problème. Je veux bien que ce modèle d'appareil n'ait pas de géo-localisation (gps), mais je SAIS qu'il y a des données exif et même dans le commentaire, ce n'est pas clair. La date !\nSur certaines photos, l'horodatage n'apparait pas (normal, on l'affiche ou non à volonté). Mais pourquoi la date/heure apparait-elle subitement sur les photos de nuit ? Parce que l'appareil s'est réinitialisé avec les paramètres par défaut (hordatage On) ? Ça aurait pu expliquer que la date n'est pas la bonne, mais l'appareil indiquerait alors le mois de janvier, non avril… 2013 pour une histoire qui se passe si j'ai bien compris en 2014.",

The photo of Kris’ head where her face can’t be seen was taken on the 8th and in the photo it’s difficult to make out anything but it also looks like some of Lisanne’s hair is in there too and there’s blank space or sky at the edges of the photo, not ground so it looks like Kris is sitting up or at least leaning over in the photo… or being propped up. Super weird. And it’s very unclear if her hair is covering her face or if the photo is of the back of her head. But you can’t see her face so it’s impossible to confirm whether she was alive in that photo…",

Of all the channels I have viewed here on u TuBe it seems like the hair photo of Kris Kramer doesn’t show the very top portion of picture.  I found a picture ( the hair photo ) of Kris K on this fellow u tuBer that I would like people to view.  They are @ , You don’t fool me’ .  The reason I’m referring to this u tUBe channel is because it shows the upper portion of the nighttime hair photo of Kris Kramer at 5:10 in video.   Now please look at very top of photo just left of Kris K. hair.   You will have to blow up the photo but you can clearly see a man standing in the background facing the camera.  At least that is what it looks like to me.  Don’t know if anyone has ever commented on this but please take a look for yourself.  Comments please !",

The first photo where you can see a clear shadow from Kris who had backpack on is at 11:25, close to midday, and the shadow is quite short as expected. Then there is a photo of Lisanne at 11:42 and the shadow is even shorter as expected since it's closer to noon. The shadow length is what you would expect for noon as the sun is almost directly above, Lisanne is now wearing the backpack. It's possible they simply switched backpacks to pose for photos, or when they took the camera out and took turns to wear the backpack. Also note the direction of the shadow is the same for Lisanne and Kris, keeping in mind the photos are taken before noon, after noon the shadows would be in the opposite direction. The last normal photo they took was at 13:54 , so it would've taken atleast 1 to 1.5 hours to hike back to start of trail, so around 3:00 to 3:30. so their shadows at this time would be much longer and in the opposite direction to the ascent photos!",

        "text": "A lot of ur research isn't exactly accurate. First, they didn't start making distress calls an hour into the hike, it was 4 hours into the hike when they made 1st distress call. None of the regular photos they  took of themselves  hiking were during that time period -- so it's misleading to say they looked \"sad\" in some of the photos -- all of those would've been taken before they knew they were lost (or if u think distress calls were due to one of them getting injured, before the injury). \n\nAlso the photo of kremer's hair did not include blood -- SOME PEOPLE THINK it shows blood, but that's an opinion/interpretation, it's not a fact that there was blood in the hair.  They also think whomever released to camera photos edited them 1st & tried make it look darker in one section of the hair (to make ppl think it was blood), but i don't think u can clearly see blood in the photo. \n\nAnd finally, the photo that was deleted from the camera they think was actually deleted by the PD on accident when they were going through the pics initially. I think u purposely told some facts wrong in this case to get more views.",

        "text": "Though murder and rape are very common reasons why young women go missing, especially in this part of the world, getting lost is also a very likely possibility. I feel like there are many holes in the 'murder and kidnapping' theory. People seem to think that the Panamanian police are trying to pass this off as them getting lost when they know there was a violent crime involved for tourism reasons, but there were cases before and after this where someone went missing and the police later found that they had been murdered and raped in one case. Why would the police go thru such trouble and risk to photo-shop photos and make up stories in an age where technology means everyone is watching? Why was there no effort to try to cover up all these other violent crimes? I also think that it is very unlikely any criminal would 'fake' 911 calls every day deep in the jungle as well as take a bunch of random pictures to throw off police. The best and easiest solution in this case would be to destroy the phones and camera along with any other evidence. Also, the calls were made to both 911 and 112, which is the Dutch emergency line. Are you saying this criminal took the time to find out where the girls were originally from, what the emergency line is over there and came up with the idea to call it every day in the case someone goes searching thru their call records? This would have to be some really insightful criminal going thru a ton of trouble to do things the hardest way possible, when as I previously mentioned, destroying the evidence would be the safest and easiest way to not get caught. The bag being found in good condition, in me eyes, probably means it was not in the river at any time and may have been left behind by the girls and found by someone (like a native) who kept it for some time and then returned it/got rid of it once realizing what it was and the implications of having it. You can say it is strange that the bag is in too good of a condition for being in a jungle for so long, but we already know that it was with Lisanne in the jungle for at least a week and if it hasn't showed significant signs of damage in that time then it is not unreasonable to assume it could stay in that condition after a month or more. The bras being in the bag is normal; wearing a bra or underwear while all wet can give you a really bad rash. The girls probably took off their bras and maybe Kris took off her pants too in an effort to get her underwear dry. I also want to address the idea that getting lost on the trail was impossible; that may be sort of true, considering you actually stick to that trail. If the girls had left the trail, even to relieve themselves, there is the possibility they got turned around and could not find their way back to it. If you look at the surrounding area in the final daytime photos taken I'm sure you can imagine how hard it would be to find the path again once you are no longer near the stream and have walked down into the dense foliage. I think that at some point between the time that last photo was taken and before the first call to emergency lines the girls wandered off the trail and got lost. Maybe they were calling because it was going to get dark soon and they could not find their way back or maybe an accident had already occurred. We do know Lisanne's foot was broken as if something had fallen on it when her remains were found and that Kris's head was bleeding at the time the night pictures were taken. It is really too bad they did not leave us any videos explaining what happened or to remember them by, but that isn't evidence that they were attacked and didn't have time to do it. I know that I personally would not want to leave behind any messages; I know my family knows I love them and I would feel pretty ashamed about explaining to them how I had made a mistake and gotten lost. I wouldn't want people viewing those kinds of videos of me after I was dead and I wouldn't want them to be the last way people I loved saw me; after reading her diary, I feel Lisanne was the same way. It is also possible she was sick and had a fever at the time when it finally became apparent that this was the end. I know the parents say that the girls wouldn't ever wander off the trail because they were responsible, but as much as I hate to say it, the fact that they went there alone without a guide even though they had already booked him for the next day was highly impulsive and irresponsible. The clothes they wore and the items they packed also showed that they had no idea what was in store for them in the jungle and once it got dark, cold and wet it is possible they could have suffered hypothermia unless they found some kind of shelter. I'll finish off by saying that the apparent 'bones' and 'shadowy figures' people keep finding in the pictures are obviously your mind playing tricks on you. In the last few photos Kris does look concerned but they are still clearly on the trail though the last one where she is standing in a large junglescape looks like they may have already gotten turned around. I personally would have taken more photos of landmarks but keep in mind the jungle probably all looked the same to them and one of them was probably injured so rationally assessing the situation and retracing their steps became more and more difficult.",

        "text": "What I didn't catch you mention about the tour guide is one thing about guilty parties - they involve themselves as much as possible in the case. This can be done for various reasons. One is to keep abreast of the investigation - what is found, what investigators know, how close they are to evidence or potentially solving the case. Two is because they enjoy seeing the fruits of their crime play out - the investigators squirming for answers - they get a sense of superiority from outsmarting, if you will, the investigators. Everything I have heard and read on this case circumstantially points to the tour guide. I would have focused my investigation on him, his coffee farm, employees that could have conspired out of fear of him & I would have interviewed in a formal setting as many of his tour guide customers, particularly female ones, as possible. My suspicion is that he told them where to go because he knew the area intimately & then at some point killed them, probably at his coffee farm, took those pictures, deleted an incriminating one, & that he himself was the one \"attempting\" to dial emergency services in an area he knew wouldn't have proper coverage. He did all this to support the narrative that the two were lost. He then later could easily place some remains, their backpack in various areas going unnoticed to further support this narrative. I believe he would have PC's at his coffee farm - whether for inventory, receipts or whatever else related to running this farm - and would have deleted an incriminating photo, that perhaps would have linked him to the crime. I don't believe they were ever lost out in the jungle for a week, they were probably held for days, then killed. As a final note about the incorrect password usage - I would be willing to bet the girls knew each others phone passwords because they were very close friends and also because they were traveling & just in case of an emergency either one could use either phone. They were rather prepared and intelligent young women, they would have thought of this. Who wouldn't know the password? The tour guide.",

Finally, the pristine backpack and the suspicious other \"random\" findings weeks later don't add up either. and maybe it's just my own theory, but i don't think it was one person. it would be interesting to know if there were other people in the cab with the girls when they were dropped off at the hike. but no one can confirm that from what you said. thanks for all the hard work on laying this out for everyone! dropped you a sub. the nighttime photos still give me chills.",

        "text": "Very thorough and empathetic analysis, thank you. As a young woman this case twists my stomach in knots of existential horror and dread, but I keep coming back to it in some masochistic hope that the truth has been unveiled. Something about the ultimate fear of the jungle in darkness, the switch from happy innocence to murky dark photos of the forest and hair, is just so nightmarish. But what really sticks to me as absolutely abhorrent evidence that some pure sadistic evil took place is the \"rolled up skin\". That kind of piece of remain could simply not be the result of animal or natural decay. I plead to all other women - from the west or otherwise - don't risk travel to any countries that are less developed, less tolerant and less enlightened than your own home country. It is simply not worth the risk. My heart bleeds for these lovely bright young women who simply did not know the darkness in our world",

Lisanne probably attended to Kris' wounds with whatever was available, fruitlessly.  She carried Kris with her, but the slow and deliberate movements she had to make in such an effort likely attracted attention, either from gangs or wildlife. The night photos might be an attempt to frighten away or identify pursuers, a last-ditch effort made on low battery, and might not have needed a PIN (I know my phone has an emergency camera feature that does not require unlock). Many of the decisions made are hard to explain, but reason is often subdued by the franticness of emergency. May these two souls rest in peace, and the families they left behind find closure.",

The dog probably KNEW the attacker, as they were a local.\n2. The girl's items and clothes, everything had been went through and rummaged around, as if someone was looking for something.\n3. They were suppose to go with a GUIDE, but decided to go by themselves on the hike. They got a bad vibe from the dude.\n4. The backpack was found several kilometers away from where the bleached bones were found.\n5. The camera might have been used to illuminate the dark, after they got lost, but someone found it and deleted 1 photo in particular.\n6. The phone logs indicate someone tried to use a PIN code to access it, but couldn't, so they powered off the device.\n\nIt's pretty clear what happened here. These poor girls were killed and kept captive. I think someone showed up on the trail and offered to take them on a shortcut back to the village, but then dismembered and killed them, taking their bra and backpack to plant the evidence in the rice patties. That is why the contents weren't wet or dirty from the river. So freaking sad. I believe Kris was held as a hostage and the picture of her hair was after she was dead, to try and throw the police off. I also think Lisanne got separated from Kris and managed to get away but stuck in the darkness of the jungle with the camera, only to be tracked down and her body left for the animals. This would explain the bleached bones and different levels of decomposition. I hope these girls get the justice they deserve. So many people go missing in Panama.",

        "text": "In the disappearance of these two Dutch girls, there are two situations that I don't understand and I believe that need a more careful analysis:\n1-If in the first two calls to the Dutch emergency number, they were already under the control of kidnappers, why didn't the criminals take the phones, the camera and all their belongings?\n\nThis doesn't make any sense! No offenders with murderous or sexual intentions would risk being photographed by their victims, or even risk the girls calling the police or leaving a message recorded on their cell phones for when they are found by the authorities.\n\n2- Why don't you have any attempt to call 911 during the night?\n\nWhat would be the worst moment for two girls from an urban environment, lost in the middle of a tropical jungle?\nDo you agree with me that this worst moment would be to spend the night in the forest?! Exhausted, cold, with animals moving on the ground, animal movement in the dark forest, a plague of insects, rain spray, hunger, thirst and darkness everywhere. This would undoubtedly be the time when they would most try to connect to an emergency number, but they didn't.\n\nTrying to explain these two situations, the best way to harmonize was as follows:\nLisanne and Kris decided on their own, to continue the trail past the viewpoint, when they realized they couldn't make it back before nightfall, or because they really got lost and disoriented, they decided to make the first two calls in the late afternoon of April 1st. . Without success, they must surely have screamed for help. They were certainly answered and rescued by someone who heard them both scream, or someone who somehow passed them on the trail. This would explain why the girls did not attempt to call an emergency number during the night, that is, they felt safe to be accompanied by someone they believed to be trustworthy and well intentioned.\nAfter that, they certainly went with that someone, to some nearby property, where they continued to be deceived by lies that reassured them, but that at dawn and after a night's sleep, they always tried to make another emergency call, until the cell phone battery has discharged.\nIt was at that moment that this someone realized that they were totally incommunicado and certainly decided to attack and take their belongings that were all inside the backpack.\nFrom then on, all the evil that befell the girls began.\n\nIn my opinion, between the moment the last cell phone ran out of charge and the dawn of the 8th, Kris Kremers was killed, so in the photos taken on the 8th, only the hair of a lifeless body of Kris appears, trying to simulate a disappearance, with them lost in the night trying to signal their position in the woods and kris dead in Lisanne's arms (who doesn't appear in the photos) as it's the killer planting false evidence, not Lisanne!\n\nAs the pieces of Lisanne Froon's skin were found in mid-June, in an initial state of decomposition, this shows that Lisanne was killed in early June and was under the control of this someone who killed her, for about 60 days. She was the last to die.\n\nNote 1: Seeing the holes in Kris' Jeans, it shows that her dead body was dragged a short distance, where it was thrown. That is, this may indicate that the place where Kris and Lisanne were killed and the bodies were subjected to a chemical treatment for dismemberment and then concealment, are very close to each other, and may be in the vicinity of this property where they felt \"safe\" .\n\nNote 2: The photo of Kris' hair at night, may not have been photographed in the forest, but in a closed and dark environment.\n\nNote 3: Kris' boot found, was it clean and without any remains inside? No animal in the forest, would be interested in carrying a leather boot in her mouth! It's not food! That's how the animals would see this boot, any object, they would have smelled it and gone. That boot was taken to the forest by the killer.\n\nNote 4: The police know of more evidence, maybe even the photo that was deleted. At the very least, they want to make some strategic use.\n\nConclusion: Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon, were held captive in an environment they thought was safe, were killed, stripped naked, with the bodies being dismembered by some chemical process as yet unknown. Some dismembered parts, along with the girls' boots, clothes and backpack with all the girls' belongings, were deliberately abandoned along the straight-line trail to create false leads and simulate that the girls died of hunger and thirst after getting lost in the deep in the forest.\n\nThe death of these innocent girls touched me a lot! This is my small contribution to unravel their deaths and thus lead to a punishment, the possible murderer and the possible collaborators.\n\nFortaleza-CE, Brazil.\n\nI very much hope that Jesus Christ will comfort Kris and Lisanne's parents.",

Carnivorous animals would be attracted to the scene.  They may well have climbed up for selfies to high points, thus leaving their packs etc near the river, which is why their backpack floated off eventually, maybe after some heavy rains.  So sad indeed RIP",

        "text": "Around the same time I went into the amazon basin alone to visit a tribe, there are 1000 ways to die. \n\nI ended up going in alone as my friends bailed. At a village I met a tribesman with his family and they took me to the main tribal camp. Things can happen that most don't even think about, quick sand will stop you long enough to be killed. Jaguars are smarter/stronger predators than man, the elder hunters of the tribe feared this word. Not to mention accidents from falling, dehydration, everything is poisonous snakes/spiders/frogs - everything. Being lost in the basin is probably a feeling most Westerners wouldn't be able to handle well in real life, if you're actually there... it's dark, everything's moving, everything's dangerous, every time you look down something new is crawling on you.\n\r\nNights are the worst BY FAR. This can be a serious anxiety and panic inducer.  Speaking from experience about the 90 photos they found, I was in a hammock and could hear cracking sticks around me, damn scary, pitch black, if I had a camera with a flash, I would have used it to help see in the dark.\n\r\nThe tribe I was with never met with the uncontacted tribe 20 mins away as it always led to bloodshed, there are no rules, there are no police. Men of society, or tribes men, are free to act as they wish, nobody's watching. People who knew about these girls - after it exploded with international news - would cover it up with misleading evidence to point you right when you should be going left, like the bag pack, hence why we still have truth seekers going round in circles of speculation for years about this. If someone knew in the tribal/village community, regardless of what happened,  given that news strangely travels very quickly through word of mouth, it's important to remember that tourism brings a lot of money in to these places, so much so that it can become dependable for some who will do anything to protect it.\n\nThe amazon is an unforgiving machine which recycles and feeds off of everything. The most common predator in there is arguably man, but it could be a combination of 1, 2, or 3/1000 things which will kill you.  In my opinion, this will never be solved.",

That's the only real thing that makes sense to me. There is no other reason why there things were found staged the way they were. That there was a pic that was deleted permanently, which was probably a pic of the killer. Why else would someone go through the trouble to permanently delete the photo?! I wonder if there has been anyone else that has gone missing in that area before or since. 🤔",

This was also around the time the last phone was dying, so they wouldn't have been able to use the flashlight from the phone. I then theorize that Kremers fell in the dark and suffered a blow to her head and was possibly unconscious. Again, using the flash from the camera as a light, Froon took the pic of the back of Kremers head to get a look at her injury. This would explain the failed attempts to log in to Kremers phone if she was unconscious and hadn't given Froon her passcode before being injured. As for the placement of their backpack and the deleted photo, definitely tough to come up with an explanation that doesn't involve foul play...",

The camera being used in the dark sounds like maybe they were kidnapped, and one or both managed to escape with the camera & tried to use it for light(which is bad if trying to outrun someone in an unfamiliar landscape as of course they needed to find their way but they wouldn't want to give away their location)... They probably caught a picture of someone pursuing them, and the person or people who killed them permanently deleted the photo to protect the identity after they caught up... The killer or killers might of wanted to use them as an example or something to scare tourists away, or maybe wanted to tell the authorities they were too good to be caught or something? I am not a murderer so I have no idea for sure...\n\nThe dog returning without them could be the dog knew whoever grabbed them(sounds highly probable in a small town), or they lost the dog so the dog returned home without them.\n\nSince there were other remains i wonder if it was confirmed who the other people were. Like did the people disappear around the same time, or were they longer-- maybe a year or more earlier or slightly later?",

A needle in a haystack.. \n\nHe found the cameras and plastic sunglasses in mint dry clean condition after months in a jungle, not a scratch on the plastic sunglasses or any water danage to electronics. \n\nThe camera had a photo deleted from a computer which state of the art forensic software could not recover. \n\nMy theory. \nHe asked them to go on a tour with them and sleep over at his ranch in the jungle overnight alone with him.\n\nThey refused, which drove his obsession. Many guys cant handle rejection. They were captured on day 1 on the trail,, told to go deeper in the opposite direction to his coffee plantation. He his son and other people raped them, used them as sex slaves. They chopped them up into pieces, They buried the bones in fertilizer from his coffee plantation which bleached the bones. \n\nI discovered that the indiginous there for thousands of years, will chop up the remains of people, strip them of flesh and keep the hair, skull and other bones , in their culture the keeper of the bones inherits the spiritual energy of the deceased, they gain power from the bones and hair. One girls hair was brightly colored so has extra mystical powers in their belief. \n\nOnce lots of search parties involved , he thought his properties could be searched,  ditched the bag which was in mint condition the contents and a couple bones to throw off investigators.\n\nHis multiple properties were never searched by cadaver dogs. \n\nHe was last person to see them alive.\n\nPolice covered it up because it will kill the tourism industry and the third world will become a 4th world country if tourists found it serial killer rapists are there.\n\nThe taxi driver was murdered, and two guys who swam with the girls were murdered.\n\nFinally, the icing on the cake. \nI found a video of the tour guide giving the parents a tour on the pianists trail, guess what's said on camera in their language. \n\n\" is that the gringos parents?\"\n\" yeah\" \n\" dont say anything! \"\n\nWjy would tour guide whisper to the other native \" dont say anything to the gringos parents. Stay quiet!\" While giving a your to look for them.\n\nOften killers get involved to get close to the investogation and cover their tracks. Involved from day one he also went in their bedroom the next morning after they were kidnapped. \n\nConclusion. \n\nTour guide is killer and other natives there knvolved in cover up.",

The men who were murdered afterwards were likely also involved in the criminal organisation, not innocent themselves, there’s just a high turnover within that line of work— especially if higher ups think a reward might be too tempting for their underlings to resist.",

L'anno scorso ho \"indagato\" a lungo questo caso, molto inquietante e tragico,  al di là della morte delle ragazze stesse, per i drammatici e inquietanti retroscena, alcuni punti che mancano nel tuo video che è comunque ben fatto e rispettoso:\n.La famigerata guida era già stata \"segnalata\" nei vari siti turistici per comportamenti molestatori nei confronti  dei turisti e per atteggiamenti inappropriati . Recensioni tra l'altro facilmente rintracciabili in rete...\n. Lo zaino è riapparso non a caso quando la famiglia ha alzato la posta in gioco, bottino che gli abitanti del luogo avrebbero voluto spartirsi. Ci sono dei video dove dei giornalisti facendo credere le camere siano spente riprendono la gente del posto che letteralmente ridono e scherzano riguardo la \" sparizione \" della ragazze...\n. Tutta la comunità sapeva benissimo cosa sarebbe successo alle ragazze.\n. La polizia ha rilasciato solo in parte le foto presenti  nella macchina fotografica,  molte di esse sono state Photoshoppate dalla polizia stessa, tutte le altre foto sono state recuperate dopo grazie ai genitori delle ragazze che si sono rivolti a chi di dovere.\n. Manca il resoconto del diario di viaggio e relativi dettagli,  ad esempio per tutta la durata del viaggio ci sono delle foto che mostrano dei soggetti che si ripetono in torno a loro... sin dall'arrivo all'aeroporto.\n. È vero che è foresta  ma pur sempre un sentiero creato per i turisti.\n. Juan perea ha fatto un grande lavoro riguardo a questo caso, tra l'altro è possibile consultare quasi tutte le foto nei suoi documenti google.\n. Le ragazze non sono state mai trovate perché da subito prese e nascoste, tenute in vita a stenti,  le foto sono state fatte nei rari momenti di lucidità probabilmente.\nLa polizia di Panama non ha quasi mai collaborato praticamente, sono stati i genitori a dover muovere mari e monti e di tasca loro per poter avere qualche stralcio di risposta.\n.Il tassista è morto ammazzato poco dopo.",

The girls were targeted before they even arrived in Boqeute, in other words they were set up. I believe the perpetrators had control of their phones,  and also took the strange night photos. And I'm betting that the rest of their bones could be found on Felicanos coffee farm/ Ranch. But police have never investigated there, for me it's the first place to look after the initial bones were recovered, and if I remember correctly, the bones were found by none other than Felicano.

        "text": "One of my thoughts on why there was no distress in at least some of the photos:  if some one who was a predator joined them, they would have appeared friendly and harmless by manipulation and smiles.  If the girls became suspicious at some point, they may have quietly agreed to pretend friendly so as to throw the predator off and possibly get away.  They also might have tried a run for it, when they felt in danger, in desperation and went off the trail, only to be followed.  Leaving evidence behind could just be carelessness on the predator’s part.  There also may have been less and less other people on the trail, so no one to join forces with.  The predator would be very sure of themselves and even with plans to leave the country so no concern about being found.  And so much more.\n\nI have been in situations like that where you are trapped because of a flat tire, in the middle of nowhere, and in those days no cell phones....😬 if you act suspicious openly you are in trouble.  Also travellers like these girls are generally more trusting of fellow travellers.",

The five young gang members who lived in the area are connected on several levels to the girls including a photo on one of their phones showing them swimming with the girls. Locals claim they had seen the girls return from the walk and were picked up in a car. The authorities did not investigate it further leading me to think they were protecting the gang. At least 2 of the men were later found dead.  It's also possible the girls were lured to the village with a promise of work purely to be trafficked or used for organ harvesting explaining why they were treated so rudely. Quite a few have gone missing in the area. It's probably the best theory I have heard so far. There's a 2 part vid on here that looks into it.",

        "text": "I started reading so much about this that I think there are at least 2 people that should be investigated but I don't want to name them. They are not the boys they met which they mention in their diaries. The diaries are huge clues in my opinion for a couple reasons. It shows they were positive about everything including the hot sun and heavy rain, and it all turned when they arrived in Boquete. When they were turned away after being told they had work. They said in the diaries that both them and the people they were staying with found it \"strange\". A couple days later they go missing. The tour guide says he was supposed to meet them the next day but there is no proof of that, yet he confirms this. Why did they never mention it in their diary? Also why did the tour guide go looking for them at their house that day? Do tour guides usually get very concerned if a client doesn't appear for a tour that they go searching for them around town including their residence?  The tour guide also has a coffee farm in that jungle. So he just left his coffee farm, and everything he was doing to go look for 2 girls who didn't show up? Then finds their foot behind a tree?\nThe other reason I think the diaries are important is it shows they wrote in their diaries everyday. Lisanne even jokes \"of course I'll fill you in\" after she misses 3 days, and she even includes the dates. That was just a few days before the hike. So if they are using their cell phone every day to call 112 or 911, then why wouldn't at least 1 of them leave 1 message. If they tried sending a text, even if it doesn't send it's still there and sometimes sends when you reach a signal. They 1st call for Emergency on April 1st. The iPhone is turned on April 11th for 64 minutes and then shut off with 22% battery. \nSo that means after the cell phone is activated on April 11th, it must then be placed back into the backpack, zipped up, and end up next to a river. While a foot is behind a tree, and other bones are far away from each other. What river only rips people to shreds but leaves the backpack in perfect condition. Also, how are they taking photos near a boulder and trees on April 8th? Kris' hair was clean and only a little messy. We know it's Kris' hair because it's in focus and it's red hair.\nAlso I know somebody who was left for dead in Costa Rica, a country they visited right before going to Panama and he only survived because his friends went looking for him. He was bleeding for 14 hours after some locals in a truck pushed him off the side of the road when he was on his ATV. I started reading about other stuff too like robberies on the trail, and other people's experiences they had while on the trail and what they saw. Many saying it seems very hard to get lost unless you  really wanted to go into the jungle, these girls packed light and 1 has asthma. Also the parents say they aren't dumb and I agree. \nPlus I read in 2020 police walked into the middle of a satanic ritualistic sacrifice taking place in the Jungle in a hut that looked like a small church by some religious sect claiming they were \"anointed by God\". Victims included pregnant women, and children. They were also from the same Tribe that turned in the backpack of the 2 missing girls.",

These are the most logical ways for them to have hiked, as the trail from where they left follows the el Pianista for a short while. Whichever way they went they would have had to climb up to about 1800m at least if not 2000m to cross the watershed and enter the other drainage. \n\nThe Culebra river is NOT JUST 15 km from where the women were last seen! \nIt is over 35 km away AS THE CROW FLIES!!! \nAlso, this guy means the Chianguinola RIVER not the Chianguinola PROVINCE! Chianguinola Province is all the way over on the EAST COAST! Chianguinola Province is over 70km from where the girls were. \n\nIn order to get to the Culebra River the girls would have had to hike up El Pianista, climb 1800-2000m cross the watershed and enter Bocas del Torro Province. From there if they went downhill they would have entered into the Chianguinola river drainage first. Most likely around the middle fork of the Chianguinola river. From there they would have had to hike down the Chianguinola river. The Culebre river empties into the Chianguinola river near Punta Blanca and La Mina where the two rivers form a lake. That is an insane distance from where the girls were last seen. It is at least 35 if not 40 km!!!! \n\n\nAlso, where the bags were found was UPRIVER on the Culebre, so the girls would have had to go up the Pianista river, cross the watershed at 1800m to 2000m of elevation, go down into the Chianguinola river drainage. They would then have had to follow this river for like 40 km and finally they would have had to GO UP THE CULEBRA RIVER in order to get to the small village near where the packs were found. There were hundreds of fingerprints on their backpacks and belongings.\n\nAccident theory:\nOn one hand, it is very easy for someone to slip, have a fall and hurt themselves, but there were two of them. The girls were obviously not planning on hiking, but they still could have survived a very long time without food there, and being in a river drainage, they would have had plenty of access to water. The temperatures in that area in April are on average between 25°C and 15°C. Higher up they temperatures would have been a little cooler. The girls certainly would not have died of the heat up there in April. \n\nIronically, it would have been quite possible for them to get hypothermia at night especially if they were wet. It is almost always wet in that area. Did they have anything with them to make a fire with?  I do not know what the girls' hiking or orienteering skills were like, or if they really knew where they were going, when they set out. It does not seem like they planned to hike for days. It looks more like the planned to go the 750 or so meters up the La Pianista trail to the summit, make some photos and return. \n\nDid they get turned around and go into the Chianguinola river drainage thinking it was the Pianista river? That is possible, but they would have certainly realized that at some point. If not by dark om the first day, then certainly by noon the next day. I find it highly unlikely that they would travel 40 km down the Chianguinola river, passing the rather large Rio Playita entering the Chianguinola from the left (West) and even passing the river Estrelita also entering from the left or West only to turn up the Culebre after what would have taken them at least 2-5 days and over 40km of hiking. It just does not make sense. Unless they did not know what they were doing got lost and panicked? If they had any sense at all and had been camping or hiking at all before then I just do not see this happening. \n\nAs far as I can recall the weather was nice for a few days and then it did rain. Perhaps they got turned around and were lost headed down the Chianguinola thinking it was the Pianista for awhile and then got caught in a flash flood? Their bones from what I understand, were found strewn all over. Most of them were in the riverbed, but some where higher up. If I recall correctly the bones were found years after the girls disappeared. One was a boot with the girl's foot still in it, but there was no signs of severing or broken bones and the investigators believe that the limb became separated after severe decomposition. Drowning would explain why most of the bones were found in the river drainage. The bones found higher up on the banks could have been carried there by scavenging animals. \n\nApart from that, there are venomous snakes and jaguars, but those scenarios are pretty unlikely. I suppose it could have been possible for one of them to have gotten hurt and then have been predated by jaguars, but this theory is very implausible. The most likely scenario here is that one of the girls got hurt and the other girl went for help and got lost or hurt herself. \n\nFoul Play:\nFoul play seems to be the most likely theory to me. Their packs were found 40 km away from La Pianista as the crow flies that is up one river over a continental divide of 2000m, then 35-40 km down another river and then up another river for like another 2-3 km. It seems unlikely that a gang would take them to the city and go clubbing with them only to come back out into the jungle and dispose of the bodies in such a remote area. There is no vehicle access out there. No. More likely they ran into someone or went with someone. Someone, whom they knew. Maybe someone, who was going to \"show them the area\". He got them out there alone and he murdered them. It could have been up to several people. If they partied perhaps they wanted to party in the jungle. This seems far more plausible to me. \n\n\nAs much as I know how easy it is for people to die of exposure. I cannot imagine that it what happened to them. That area is remote, but it is not like no one walks along those trails. There are huts, sheds, remote homesteads along the Rio Chianguinola on both sides. A few of them are probably visible from the river. If the houses had any kind of lighting, they would have been very visible at night.",

        "text": "I have researched this intensely some 4 years ago, and I think I've got it figured out. Not the question, who exactly was the main culprit, but it's fairly clear they were abducted and kept as prisoners, and gangr*ped over a long time. \nAs I speak Spanish, I could search local social media, and found quite a few off-the-record remarks and insider jokes, about \"keeping gringos in the basement\" and \"being an abductor\" or \"girl killer\". This area is narcos territory, and the local youth are heavily implicated with gang activity. Some of them had a beef with another group, and that's when they started hinting at what these guys were trying to hide. The locals probably all know who did it, but don't say a word, because there have already been a few suspicious deaths of people \"who knew too much\".\nThe girls managed to flee, but fell down a ravine, this is when the last photos were taken. Kris died of her injuries, and Lisanne was taken back to the dungeon.\nWhen the parents arrived and search parties started to comb the area, the narcos got nervous and wanted the police and the reporters out of the area, which is riddled with hidden cocaine kitchens. \nThat's when Lisanne was killed, too. Carefully selected remains of the girls were strategically placed, so that they could be found. A corrupt state prosecutor who was in the pockets of the narcos quickly concluded that they had gotten lost and fell victims to an accident. Case closed, now everybody go home, please.\nThere are a lot of people who know the truth, and a lot of them should be behind bars. But the truth will never come out as long as drug lords rule over the area.",

        "text": "Here are two things I know for sure. The Panamanian government had this attitude of “they are already dead, let’s not let this screw up our tourism industry” hence the mention of wild animals and the natural death in the river. \n\nThe other fact is there is a group of cannibalistic aboriginals in this exact part of panama. They are called the conojes which is Spanish for rabbits. They normally come out at night, they survive off jungle plants and stray livestock. They have been known to eat people since the first Spaniards who visited these regions. They have a rival tribe who are more civilized and welcoming, this is the tribe that the government recruited for help in finding the girls remains. \n\nThese girls are the 3rd and 4th tourists go go missing in this exact region. The first being a British man in 2009 and the second being a lone female traveller sometime after that. Not a single bone fragment of theirs was found. I believe the girls were found, abducted and eaten by this cannibalistic tribe, who are well known and very feared by locals. The chirqui is their stomping grounds, it is their home and they know those trails better than anyone else. \n\nThis explains how the girls stayed alive. Why their money was not taken, and why so many of their belongings were found. They embarked on what would be a 8 day journey into the depths of the jungle. They didn’t do it for fun or out of ignorance. \n\nThe fact that so many people follow this story and know every minute detail about it, but have never even known that there is a cannibalistic tribe that calls that jungle home is a sign that this has been covered up. That would be a tourism nightmare for panama. Hence the authorities in panama exhausting every alternative excuse even though nothing fits. \n\nThe reason there was so much evidence left is because this tribe has no knowledge of forensics, criminal trials or evidence. No modernized murderer would leave a boot a backpack and bone fragments scattered around. Even a camera containing photos of where the women were abducted. But a primitive nocturnal tribe with almost no external contact would do just that.",

The first thing I thought of when you said they were taking pictures of where they were..was to document where they were headed for the person that found there belongings (police) it makes total sense to say if something happens to us maybe the police can figure out what by these photos. How does someone's entire foot become detached from ones body without foul play. They say it's common but I've never heard of someone's foot just detaching itself from the rest of the body. It's just weird n clearly they were trying to reach out for help just didn't have service. Which is so sad. & I think the dog must of ran when they encountered the person(s) responsible b/c if I was lost I'd stay with the dog. That dog could potentially save you, if you encountered an animal ya know.  & clearly he knew how to get back home. I think that dog ran off & he was alerting the host family that something happened.

They should be taken more seriously than just being \"weird.\" Speaking of weird, I also don't know why people omit the guide so much. He was the last one to see them, offered to take them on a guided hike, has a ranch not far from where the backpack and bones were found, supposedly has a history of being inappropriate with women, and also was the one who \"found\" their bones. I mean...putting all of that together, there's just no conceivable way foul play wasn't somehow involved in their deaths. And the guide also apparently went to their room at their host family's place, when he raised the alarm they were missing, and search their room without police permission. He's fairly obviously involved somehow.",

        "text": "I'm a taxidermist and when I first started a few years ago I would look for raccoon and possum bones and whatnot in the woods near train tracks, so with the bones mentioned here, I'd be curious to know more about what the \"bleaching\" described. If the bones were corroded and the bone was flaking, you could easily say it has been bleached by human beings. But, there are natural decomposition circumstances in which a bone could end up whitened. It's very very common in places with heavy rain, and it's very common for bones found from the same animal to be not only scattered around by wildlife, and the bigger the deceased animal the bigger the scattering of the bones because the predator or scavenger is likely much bigger, and also, when bones are scattered like this early in decomposition a bone under a tree found in mud could very likely have more remaining flesh or grease (yellow/brown color) that bones found on rock or in the sun not protected as much from the rain. Also, often when someone drowns in water it's common for feet still in shoes to be found downstream because decomposition in water weakens certain joints much faster than the rest of the body so during decomposition feet will often detach in those circumstances. I hope I don't sound crazy, I'm just a taxidermist, I mean no disrespect to these girls. I do think it's very possible they got scared by something and ran off, separating them from the dog, but from what I know of decomposition I think in the end, one girl drowned, the other took photos so search parties might be able to figure it out, and then the other died of the elements, and maybe scavenging wildlife scattered the remains post mortem.",

I think they just wanted to check it out a little before they went due to curiosity. What I think happened, was they lost the dog. They tried following him and looked for him to see where he went. They probably went on that dangerous trail to see if the dog went there or not. I believe one of them fell, considering it was raining. So the other took her phone and tried calling 911 multiple times. She wasn't getting reception. Her friend possibly passed out or died, so she tried unlocking her friends phone to see if her phone had better reception. Eventually the phones died, so she gave up. I can't explain those weird photos, but I think other than that it makes sense. The dog new where his home was, so he just ran back. That's what I personally think",

I believe she might have blacked out for some time, maybe out of fear and shock, and thats probably why she lasted that long. It may have given her extra energy she needed to go on. Also, a person can survive without food for quite a while but obviously every person and situation is different. They seem like outdoor people, for 2 healthy girls with no medical conditions, not unheard of to go 1 or 2 weeks without food. Water on the other hand is a different story, I'm thinking they may have used streams and rain as their source to stay hydrated. Maybe even urine as its known to have nutrients and help in these situations. \nSomeone here also mentions she may have survived on Kris's body. Idk about that, but regarding the pictures... I strongly believe scaring off animals and using it as a light source were not the reason the pictures were taken. They were the result of fear, shock, confusion and were probably taken in a daze. That explains the many photos minutes apart. Idk why but I have a strong feeling this was taken by someone who's given up trying to survive and is no longer using any common sense. I don't believe at all that there was any foul play. The bones being far apart (if thats true) isn't that strange to me either. If you watch animals feed, you'll see why. Sometimes they'll pick their meat apart, pick up a piece and run away to protect from other animals disturbing their lunch. Some will take the food to their babies and some just fight and steal bones from each other. Put a dead animal in the middle of a jungle and come back after 10 days....",

        "text": "In the disappearance of these two Dutch girls, there are two situations that I don't understand and I believe that need a more careful analysis:\n1-If in the first two calls to the Dutch emergency number, they were already under the control of kidnappers, why didn't the criminals take the phones, the camera and all their belongings?\n\nThis doesn't make any sense! No offenders with murderous or sexual intentions would risk being photographed by their victims, or even risk the girls calling the police or leaving a message recorded on their cell phones for when they are found by the authorities.\n\n2- Why don't you have any attempt to call 911 during the night?\n\nWhat would be the worst moment for two girls from an urban environment, lost in the middle of a tropical jungle?\nDo you agree with me that this worst moment would be to spend the night in the forest?! Exhausted, cold, with animals moving on the ground, animal movement in the dark forest, a plague of insects, rain spray, hunger, thirst and darkness everywhere. This would undoubtedly be the time when they would most try to connect to an emergency number, but they didn't.\n\nTrying to explain these two situations, the best way to harmonize was as follows:\nLisanne and Kris decided on their own, to continue the trail past the viewpoint, when they realized they couldn't make it back before nightfall, or because they really got lost and disoriented, they decided to make the first two calls in the late afternoon of April 1st. . Without success, they must surely have screamed for help. They were certainly answered and rescued by someone who heard them both scream, or someone who somehow passed them on the trail. This would explain why the girls did not attempt to call an emergency number during the night, that is, they felt safe to be accompanied by someone they believed to be trustworthy and well intentioned.\nAfter that, they certainly went with that someone, to some nearby property, where they continued to be deceived by lies that reassured them, but that at dawn and after a night's sleep, they always tried to make another emergency call, until the cell phone battery has discharged.\nIt was at that moment that this someone realized that they were totally incommunicado and certainly decided to attack and take their belongings that were all inside the backpack.\nFrom then on, all the evil that befell the girls began.\n\nIn my opinion, between the moment the last cell phone ran out of charge and the dawn of the 8th, Kris Kremer was killed, so in the photos taken on the 8th, only the hair of a lifeless body of Kris appears, trying to simulate a disappearance, with them lost in the night trying to signal their position in the woods and kris dead in Lisanne's arms (who doesn't appear in the photos) as it's the killer planting false evidence, not Lisanne!\n\nAs the pieces of Lisanne Froon's skin were found in mid-June, in an initial state of decomposition, this shows that Lisanne was killed in early June and was under the control of this someone who killed her, for about 60 days. She was the last to die.\n\nNote 1: Seeing the holes in Kris' Jeans, it shows that her dead body was dragged a short distance, where it was thrown. That is, this may indicate that the place where Kris and Lisanne were killed and the bodies were subjected to a chemical treatment for dismemberment and then concealment, are very close to each other, and may be in the vicinity of this property where they felt \"safe\" .\n\nNote 2: The photo of Kris' hair at night, may not have been photographed in the forest, but in a closed and dark environment.\n\nNote 3: Kris' boot found, was it clean and without any remains inside? No animal in the forest, would be interested in carrying a leather boot in her mouth! It's not food! That's how the animals would see this boot, any object, they would have smelled it and gone. That boot was taken to the forest by the killer.\n\nNote 4: The police know of more evidence, maybe even the photo that was deleted. At the very least, they want to make some strategic use.\n\nConclusion: Kris Kremer and Lisanne From, were held captive in an environment they thought was safe, were killed, stripped naked, with the bodies being dismembered by some chemical process as yet unknown. Some dismembered parts, along with the girls' boots, clothes and backpack with all the girls' belongings, were deliberately abandoned along the straight-line trail to create false leads and simulate that the girls died of hunger and thirst after getting lost in the deep in the forest.\n\nThe death of these innocent girls touched me a lot! This is my small contribution to unravel their deaths and thus lead to a punishment, the possible murderer and the possible collaborators.\n\nFortaleza-CE, Brazil.",

I mean the way he's able to use X-Ray vision and spot a girl's shoe behind a tree trunk in a jungle is really impressive. Also what a huge coincidence, the same girls he was supposed to meet and is so concerned about he shows up at their house April 2nd, ALSO finds their foot behind a tree :) \nThat is so strange, how one of the most mysterious missing person's cases would also have so many huge coincidences all circling back to 1 specific person. Also that person was never questioned or investigated. Maybe he was just so helpful they realized nobody who's as nice as him could ever commit a crime. Since when does any nice person commit a crime?\nForget all that evidence, they probably just fell off a monkey bridge into a river like Panama claims. Which explains why all the electronics in the backpack were dry and in perfect condition. They probably got separated from their back pack which is why it's so dry and not damaged. Then a week later they spot their backpack on dry land and take out their camera to take some photos of the night and Kris' hair. Then they place the camera back into the backpack and dive back into the river.\nThen on April 11th they return to the backpack, take out the iPhone, turn it on for 64 minutes and then manually shut it off with 22% battery remaining and then place it back into the backpack, zip it up, and jump back into the river where the foot goes upstream and lands behind a tree trunk. Which is then later found by the tour guide. \nAlso the tour guide calls in about a backpack that was found by a river and tells some innocent looking lady to hand it to police. Then in an interview says they came by helicopter and took the backpack from him without questioning him. I thought a woman from a tribe handed it to authorities, but he says a helicopter picked it. Either way it's fine and just a coincidence. \n\nOr he could be a suspect.",

        "text": "The \" them just being lost in the woods and dying from lack of food and water \" sounds like complete bull to me. From all the evidence collected, it almost seems complete obvious that this was a murder. First, they are in the rainforest, there are ways to filter water from streams with lack of supplies. Is it difficult? Yes, but there are ways, and if they couldn't filter it, then they could have just drank the stream water. Yes, it would be disgusting, but it would be essential for survival, and i would think of surviving first than \" is the water crystal clear?\"\nBest case scenario, the water had no side effects, worst case, they got a brain eating paritiste and died from that. ( i highly dont think that happened though )\nBut, they could have packed enough water to last a while but they were taken out, Or, A fellow hiker saw they were lost and supplied them with food and water, then said he knew the way out, so lead them and got them in a area in the woods where he thought no one would bother them. With other crimes, its always with someone leading them, saying they know the way out or that they can help them, when its the opposite. It seems like that could have happened here. As for the pictures, one of the girls could have been trying to get pictures of the suspect while either trying to get away or when they were in her/his \" care \". And for the deleted one, the suspect must have sawn one of the girls take it, and he/she told her to delete it, since it could be evidence. The suspect could have even took the phone when it was unlocked and made the girls take the passcode off so they could go on and off the phone with ease, then put a new code on before dropping it or making it seem like they were trying to get in it. Or, they ( the suspect ) were taking photos and could have accidentally taken one with their identity being seen in it, even if it was minimal, anything works in a investigation, so they could have deleted it for that reason, since the person obviously knew that there would be a investigation. The rock picture could have been taken by the killer, and all the other strange pictures could by them too, and i believe they could have been a set of clues to the girls location on the phone, but that may not have been it. The rock picture does need some looking into though, since it has the flash used.\nThe shorts can have a easy or complicated explanation. One of the girls could have been bathing in the river/ stream or the killer, for whatever reason, took them off, neatly folded them and placed them on a rock as a clue, since these sickkos enjoy leaving clues for people since, in some cases, they enjoy attention and taunting police.\n\nAll and all, very strange case yet a very interesting one, and this comment made me realize I really need to stop watching dateline and crime watch daily  XDDD anywho, thats my theory on this",

These men made sure the girls were deep in the area before approaching the girls. These men acted friendly at first, but the girls were worried. One guy said, 'hey, I'll take your photo'. That's the photo where the girl looked worried. Then the men said to the girls, 'take our photo'. That's the photo that was deleted later by the men. Sadly, the girls were perhaps raped and murdered. Possibly chopped up by the men to try and make it look like an animal had eaten and dissected the bodies. The photos and phone call attempts were made by the men. Again, to try to make it look like a real distress call. And the photo of the girl's hair/head was after she had been killed.",

        "text": "My theory on what happened to Kris and Lisanne is this. The girls met with Henry Gonzalez stepson of Felicano and some of his friends earlier in the day, or the day before. When the girls came back down from the El Pianista trail ( which by the way is a well known drug trafficking trail) lots of drugs and dealers in Boqeute, the girls met up with Henry Gonzalez and his gang and went with them to swim in the Caldera hot springs that's where the photo was taken. Henry Gonzalez made a play for one of the girls I believe it was Lisanne, and she refused his advances, and Kris tried to protect Lisanne but the Henry and the others took them to a hideout and kept them there where the girls were se abused, Kris fought back and was hit in the head or in the jaw, she was killed before Lisanne, then when they had no further use for Lisanne she to was killed, they were both dismembered and the bones were buried, they had tried to dissolve some of the bones, and later on they planted a few of the bones so they could be found, and it would look like the girls got lost and died in the jungle. Henry Gonzalez is the only remaining member of the gang, the others including the taxi driver who dropped them off at the start of the trail died in mysterious circumstances, and 1 of the gang so say was a victim of a hit and run, but was repeatedly run over by the vehicle. They were basically silenced on the orders of Henry Gonzalez because he believed they would talk. It is believed that one of the gang refused to take part in the killing of the girls, and I think he was the first to die. Felicano knows what happened to Kris and Lisanne, but he is covering up for Henry, on the trail with Kris's parents he is heard and seen on camera telling one of the other guides to keep quiet and say nothing. I believe this was planned before the girls got to Boqeute, and that's the reason why they were turned away by the school. Miriam was friends with Felicano Gonzalez, so he would have known that the girls were coming to volunteer at school. Put another way, what Felicano doesn't know about Boqeute isn't worth knowing. And let's not forget 29 year old Alex Humphrey who went backpacking in Boqeute in August 2009 and checked into a hostel and has never been seen since, and no trace of belongings or bones have ever been found. Its like he vanished into thin air. 🙏🙏🙏",

This also explains why she couldn’t get into Kris’ phone using the passcode. I think she carefully packed everything away in the hold-all and stashed it securely hoping to leave clues. The hair photo is fake and a lot of the others photos are doctored. As tourism is a massive income for Panama they needed to keep a lid on the atrocities these two vibrant young women went through. They met an horrendous death. They tried to dial 911 when they first entered the ‘trek’, why? They were obviously in danger early on. - I believe they were forced deep into the forest and were captured & killed. By a tribe, by local criminals, who knows. They were without a doubt preyed on, toyed with then murdered. Shame on the people, the police and the press of Panama who have helped to keep this quiet.",

Très contente de l'avoir découverte à travers ta vidéo.\nSelon moi la théorie de l'accident est la plus probable, ta théorie est super intéressante et je pense très proche de la réalité.\nJe pense que les filles ont utilisés le flash de l'appareil photo pour se guider dans la nuit et pour espérer que quelqu'un les voient et donc les sauvent.\nCe qui me chagrine dans cette histoire c'est les détails comme le fait que le short soit abandonné comme ça et qu'il ne soit pas à côté des ossements retrouvés. D'ailleurs pourquoi tous les ossements non pas étaient retrouvés, c'est tellement bizarre.\nMalheureusement, je pense comme toutes les histoires de disparition, on ne saura jamais vraiment la vérité.\nBon dimanche et bon visionnage à tous 🥰❤",

J'ai conscience que tout le monde ne pense pas comme moi mais personnellement j'aurai pris le temps, dans les derniers moment, d'écrire quelque chose pour expliquer ce qu'il s'est passé ou faire mes adieux à ma famille. C'est étonnant que Lisanne ne l'ai pas fait (puisqu'elle écrivait beaucoup) mais peut être qu'elle n'était plus en état de le faire 😔",

This was going to be dark soon. They didn’t know they would be lost/hidden for days... I would have called over and over again scared to sleep in jungle for the first night plus injury or lost. \n\n* • the camera - why would they have no photos of the two them together even if one was injured or lost. They could have done selfies together of where they were on the first night, again not knowing they wouldn’t be found? \n\n* Why have no further bones have ever been discovered? Noting that 3 natives bones were also discovered.\n\n* Backpack with things in it, why didn’t the need anything from the backpack with them? Whether camera, sunglasses, bras, water bottle? when they fall over or injured they just happen not to have these items with them at the time?",

        "text": "OK I'm turning my comments into a book, but the most important thing I wanted to say  that Sloan's reading focuses on. Is how the girls were in some kind of well. When they found the camera, and there were tons of pictures taken in the dark in the middle of the night early morning hours, after they had try to contact emergency number. At first I thought they were trying to document their location and try to leave some evidence of location of them, they had all these sky shots? So at first I was thinking they were yryingvti maybe map their location by the position of things in the sky, and then I realized no THEY ARE IN A WELL, that's what they are taking pictures of? If you look to the left of these photographs on some you can see a circular Like pattern the entrance has brush around the top? Some maybe the inside of the well. There is one picture that shows Chris's hair, but I think it shows detailed injuries if you zoom in. Yell me if you think these pictures look like they are inside a Well. Also some people mentioned that there is one or two photos that look very different than the other pictures of the girls where they are always taking a selfie together with big smiles, and at the summit. The one that people find disturbing is the one that just shows Chris ahead and they are past  the summit where they would have turned around, so as Sloan said he has them keep going past where most people would go and gets a photo of Chris ahead to make them look like they had gone past the trail toprovide a narrative of what happened tovtgem, also one photo was missing but not deleted from the camera, but a computer or other means? There was something that someone didn't want people to see? Another American woman went missing close by the same area, but I think it was suppose to be after these two women went missing? But as Sloane said, which makes sense is that after these two girls were gone, she was trying to use their phone, but shevwas American and why she was using 911, and also why she didn't have a password? It's not like the one friend would not give her friend the password in the circumstances they were in. Sorry for my thought diarrhea ;-D I'm curious if anyone thinks these photos are shot from inside the well? They take a picture ofvthevsky directly above them? Why not if each other? I don't know, any thoughts?",

        "text": "This video was definitely one of the best and most nuanced one I’ve seen on the case so far.  I personally still flip flop between what I believe happened to them to be honest because while there’s a lot of weird, nonsensical parts to it that don’t really fit with a lost hiker, there’s also a lot of parts that don’t really mesh with the idea of it being a crime either.  A lot of the stuff that people point to as evidence of wrongdoing can be fairly simply explained as not being suspicious, but there are definitely a few little things that make me raise an eyebrow too.\n\nThe part I have a hard time justifying with the idea of them being simply lost is the fact that no one was able to trace them at any point during the search, not even so much as a broken branch, or anything of theirs left behind until suddenly months later there stuff is so easily discoverable.  The missing photo, the decomp, all that other stuff I can fairly easily rationalize because of how peculiar things like that behave in a jungle environment, but the fact that there was no inkling of them at all during such an insanely large and thorough search is kinda baffling to me.  Idk, I doubt we’ll ever truly find out what happened though in any case sadly.",

The young men in that photo (2 of which subsequently died or were murdered) kidnapped the 2 girls, raped them, and then killed them at different times (brutal, I know). It's strongly believed that the old man tour guide and the younger cab driver were both involved... the younger cab driver was killed to silence him, either because the case was getting too much international attention or he threatened to talk. It explains why the girl's backpacks were pristine... the girls put their tops/glasses/phones in them while they went swimming and that's where they were abducted. The girls were then hidden by the kidnappers inside a cave, where the bizarre night time flash photos were taken. The girls were both eventually killed and then dismembered (grisly, I know) to hamper any investigation. Moral of the story: two attractive young women should NEVER travel to parts of the world where kidnapping, rape, and murders are basically pastimes. Very sad.",

        "text": "So I fell down the internet HARD after watching this, and have tripped across a few details that seem important. First of all ... the location of the LAST PHOTO with Kris in it (taken late afternoon the first day) has been identified and it is NOT on the main trail, it is on a very tricky and dangerous side trail, which seems to indicate the girls definitely got themselves lost one way or another. The source showed pictures of these secondary trails; they are really rough - deep ravines and sharp rocks and sadly they lead deeper into the jungle. There are documented accounts of even local guides getting lost on these jungle trails. Second...  THE 90 NIGHT PHOTOS were all taken in the span of 5 hours from 1am to 5am on night #7 and in the SAME location. So the girls were not trying to travel at night (possibly heard something that scared them so they were trying to see, or scare it away, or thought they heard someone and trying to signal?) Third (and sorry this one's a bit gruesome)... THE FOOT that was found had a lot of broken bones that the forensics examiner said were broken pre-mortem and consistent with a bad fall (which is awful, it means one of them was badly injured). \n\nMy feeling now after diving in to this mystery is the girls got lost and sadly died in a very dangerous jungle.",

Starvation?\nProbably these possibilities of death would not make a shorts fold itself on a rock: would separate ur bones and scatter all over the forests: and would not make ur bag intact and dry when found. (If the bag was in the forest for days and weeks, it would be dirted but ivestigators said \"the bag was even like \"new\")\n\n(1) aren't the girls wearing bras? it is already a given to see that they are wearing straps so we can see they are wearing bras: why is it well folded and in the bag? \n(2) the girls have no laptop with them. deleting a photo from ur phone claimed to be easily retrieved\n But that deleted photo cant be retrieved. It was claimed by the experts that the photo could have been deleted using a computer and it would even been weird to think why would they delete a photo even if they have a laptop - the bag was found weeks after and it would only take a few minutes to delete a photo using a computer but the span was WEEKS (plenty enough time to plan out things)\n(3) potential witnesses died mysteriously, the cab driver who brought the girls to the location died - MYSTERIOUSLY.\n(4) The guide was defensive. He was one of the people who last saw the girls? The first one to find the bones? I also heard, the last guy to enter their room, even - heck even a kid could figure this.\n(5) the police dept. Took 4 DAYS before starting the search and rescue. Even if they were not involve in such malice I would fucking SUE them. The first DAY: The first HOUR was critical - they could have been saved 😞\nFINALLY - these things i pointed was, for me, simple indicators that would not let me leave the case for 6 FUCKING years but authorities were so incompetent\n\nThere is no rest in peace for these girls thats why it breaks me.",

        "text": "I have a huge hunch that they were perhaps followed & kidnapped, and here's my theory of how things went down:\n\n\nAs they were hiking, they went off the beaten path & got lost.  With the dog returning home without them, I suspect that one (or both) of the girls fell and hurt themselves, and they released the dog hoping it would go home & therefore alert the host family. The girls likely stayed where they were until they realized how dark it was getting, and tried to get back by themselves while also searching for a signal to call the emergency line.  When darkness fell, they used the flash of the camera to find where they were going.  I'm assuming that photo 509 might have contained an image of the person who had been following them, or some other damning piece of evidence that led to that particular photo being deleted later by the person who took them.\n\n\nEither way, I think that at some point, Kris became so injured or so exhausted that she likely passed away, and Lisanne took Kris' phone so that she could hopefully still contact authorities and save herself, explaining the multiple failed PIN attempts, although this could also be the moment that the person following the girls had gotten ahold of Kris & he was attempting to get into her phone to make sure there was no evidence of them on it.  Either way, I think that at this point, the person who had been following them grabbed Kris while Lisanne ran on alone.  Eventually, Lisanne came to the edge of the cliff in the last photo (assuming other commenters are correct about the photo), where she was cornered and taken.\n\n\nAnd I think this psycho who found them left their backpack as a way to taunt the police.  The bleached pelvis could have been left by the killer, or could be something that the police made up to cover up their negligence in this story.  Hell, the police may have even found the bodies themselves, dead of exhaustion after being alone in the jungle for so long, but didn't want it to come to light that if they'd taken action a few days sooner, they could have located the girls alive, and subsequently be blamed for the girls' death.\n\n\nAs for how they survived so long without water, I'm not sure.  Maybe they had quite a few water bottles with them, and survived off that for so long by drinking extremely sparingly.  I mean, people's bodies can do some crazy shit when that survival instinct kicks in.\n\n\nThis story really is a heartbreaking one, with a lot of speculation and very little evidence.  It's an extremely dark situation, with multiple hard lessons for everyone to take from this.\n1)  Always make sure someone other than the people with you know where you are going and when you expect to be back, especially if you're going hiking in unfamiliar territory.\n2)  Never go off into the woods alone, especially not unprepared.  Plan for the worst, and take some time to brush up on basic survival tips, in case you do become lost.\n3)  Always be aware of your surroundings.  You never know what could be hiding near you.",

        "text": "I thought someone had come forward and explained that they were abducted by those two boys they met, held captive for about two weeks, were raped and later used to sell their organs. And that the night photos might have been taken during a night where they managed to escape, got lost and were retrieved by the abductors. \nThe one thing I don't understand is why they would not have exchanged their phone codes in that situation. The idea was that the calls were made when they were allowed to use the bathroom outside the cabin and that they were allowed to keep the phones because the abductors knew that there was no reception in the area.\nEven though this is a horrible scenario, it seems a \"better\" fate then dying lost, hurt, thirsty and starving in the jungle, at some point knowing they would never get back and never be found.\nHowever, the abduction theory would explain the clean hair several days after the disappearance. If the were lost in the junge, the hair should have been sweaty and probably tangled with dirt, leaves etc. from sleeping on the floor. It would not have been that clean. It would, however, if they were in a cabin and maybe allowed/ asked to shower or wash themselves.\nThe other thing I don't understand is the potential abductors' motivation to delete one photo and return the others. If they have abducted several women this way before, why was nothing similar found before (cameras and stuff of other victims)? Did they want the families to have one last info/ memory of their daughters or what else could have been the motivation to show this? And then, why keep the night photos, especially the hair photo? Why not delete them, too?\nSo, someone sat down with the memory card in front of a computer, deleted this one photo, returned the memory card and then put everything into backpacks and placed it in the jungle instead of keeping under cover?",

En pleine jungle ça me parait difficile d’avoir le matériel nécessaire. Une autre technique serait de remplir la carte mémoire à 100% après avoir effacé la photo, le plus simple serait de mettre l’appareil en mode RAW et d’enclencher le mode rafal, ce qui expliquerait les 90 photos suivantes qui sont incompréhensibles. Ainsi pas besoin d’ordinateur et la photo est irrécupérable. Vidéo vraiment au top merci pour votre travail c’est vraiment passionnant. Meilleures salutations.",

They met their end and those night-time photos were taken by the perpetrators in order to confuse an already inefficient and fairly amateur local police force. And the plan has succeeded (so far). If it had been the girls lost in the jungle, we know every attempt to make a call failed - bar one. Even though it only connected for 2 seconds, would they not have stayed rooted to that spot trying again and again if it had been them using the phone? Then there's the impossibility of the condition of Kris's remains being anything other than by human intervention. Quicklime produces such a bleached condition. We also have to believe they a) were naive enough to keep going when every instinct would have told them to retrace their steps b) took not one single photo after 509 and c) didn't use the available technology to leave one single audio or video message.",

The sad reality is they possibly got lost, and met with a sad fate of someone who saw an opportunity. I’m going to guess that the night photos taken were of the murderer, not either girl. It was done to skew any investigation and confuse people. They are nothing more than random photos in the dark. The one deleted was reported to have been deleted via computer, which is also a red flag. \n\nVery well done video and my heart goes out to the family and friends of these young ladies.",

Not all photos that have been deleted can be recovered because the space on the SD card can and sometimes will be overwritten by writing more data to the SD card by another photo. Take for instance I take picture 508 and 509 and then 510 then I delete 509 and I take 511 it can partially overwrite 509 but yeah weird that someone that was lost would bother to delete a photo. One scenario could have been her own phone died and and her friend died or was gone and she didn't know the pin for the other phone so maybe the camera flash was still available but the phone light wasn't. Though I know on my iPhone you can turn on the light even when locked but this might not have been the case at that time or on an android. Another thing is usually two people don't fall off a cliff together. We need more detailed information like who's phone took the picture which girls head was in the photo. Which brand phone did they have what were the settings on their phone. That was probably available if the phones were recovered. I suspect they were murdered though. Scandinavian girls don't understand the dangers in other parts of the world. Remember the Scandinavian girls that went hiking in Morocco.",

Why only twice then no other calls since they seemed happy enough in the photo of them in the spring. \n2) The school director knowing about it and setting them up. They might not have spoken Spanish but both the schoolkids and the girls probably knew English. They could have taught that way.\n3) The detailed series of events saying that the men were armed with 2 pistols and a machete. These are events that might have happened, though there is no concrete evidence.\n4) Organ harvesting isn't something that can be done in a cave by someone with no experience and equipment. You would need a sterile room and a surgeon with a decent knowledge of anatomy to harvest a set of lungs. It's not a simple procedure that you can do with a pocket knife, you have to cut the sternum, break the chest cavity open expose the lungs, cut all the blood vessels to  and from the lungs and do all of this without puncturing a lung in the process. The procedure needs to be done very quickly post mortem too. Double lung harvest is extremely difficult. A junior surgeon could maybe harvest a kidney but not a set of lungs.\n5) Why leave the girls with their phones? I guess if you were certain they couldn't phone out it makes a little bit of sense but they could leave a message, unless they did and it was deleted by Panamanian authorities. \n\nI liked the documentary, just some questions that I would like to see answered as these bits don't make much sense.",

One of the most telling clues is that one photo was deleted after a few others were taken. This hints that a third party took the later photos and deleted an incriminating photo. One of the worst things investigators did was not investigate the people taken in the photos with them in the beginning. One of the girls was wearing a bold white and red striped tank. That should've helped determine if those were the girls in the photo with the other people. Nevertheless, they should've been questioned, the owners of the restaurant should've been questioned (especially since they let their dog go with the girls after allegedly warning the girls not to go). That whole thing seems weird to me. Why warn these girls and not everyone? Why would the girls go so deep into the trail when they had the presence of mind to hire a guide the next day. This is a case for the FBI or highly trained international team, as local authorities don't seem to be willing to do the hard investigations.",

        "text": "It’s hard to separate fact from fiction. There are oddities like Feliciano’s sway over the indigenous folks (who found the backpack) and his influence even in the town. Then there’s the backpack. Wet and somewhat tattered maybe but in oddly good shape considering it was floating down a river for months during the rainy season. The fact that they did not find the girls on or near the trail must mean they were not lost on trail. It’s a well used trail. Someone would have found them and it was well searched. The jungle wasn’t, however. But, there’s no way they would have, let alone could have, gotten far in the jungle I think. The way I’ve heard it described, unless you have a machete, you really can’t penetrate it and you can’t go very far. I’m not sure exactly of the terrain there or if there’s some possible hidden precipice where they could have fallen and gotten stuck, but even then, I think someone would have heard them. They also never found the remnants of the help signals the girls had made that were featured in some of the (one of the?) night photos. I also found it odd that Kris’s hair was dry and seemingly clean in the photo Lisanne took of the back of her head. I do not think Kris was dead in this photo. It looks too much like she’s sat up and her hair isn’t falling in a way to suggest she’s lying down and there’s no ground beneath her. It’s possible they found a cave, but after a week in the jungle, I would think a girl’s bright blond hair would be absolutely filthy. It’s just odd. It’s as if they were on the trail and then poof ended up somewhere else where they must have KNOWN they couldn’t use their phones very much and they realized that their calls would not go through so they didn’t attempt more calls in that week or so that they were using their phones. It’s just so weird they never found ANYTHING to show where they may have been except the remains and backpack. Nothing. That part is very odd. Then there’s the story by the German man. Then there are the odd and contradictory stories by the villagers about when they saw the girls. Then there’s that photo of those two boys and two girls which MAY have been of them, but it’s entirely possible it’s not. Perhaps two men scared them off trail and they ended up somewhat deep in the jungle? Lissane’s bones DID show signs of excessive use ie: she walked for a very long time. And, again the jungle was not searched and I can only assume you’d get very turned around in there and possibly slip and hurt yourself. Edit: I realize this is kind of unlikely because of what I said about the jungle, but it’s also the only reason/explanation for their not being on trail and not heading back the way they came when they realized they maybe had gone too far. Otherwise there could feasibly all sorts of foul play scenarios, but it’s hard to fathom when you have the night photos. They used flash… how would their captors not see they were using it?",

        "text": "Thank you for this informative video! I heard about this case years ago and it still comes to mind from time to time. The last video I saw heavily suggested on the paranormal side. However this video had way more information and it clearly would indicate that more terrifiying events took place and locals were behind it. That would explain the weird dates on photos, odd remains with bleach on bones, belongings that well too well kept, how the items suddenly appeared, pictures with local boys and how the locals who knew about the case started dying. The last one would really indicate human faulplay here. Goverment probably trying to shield this and avoid publicity to not scare the tourism but luckily girls had parents with enough money to raise the awarness on this matter. Terrifying and sad how cruel humans can be.",

The location where this photo was taken is quite a long distance from Boquete and just doesn’t fit with the timeline of April 1st.  And if it happened before the 1st, one of the two girls would probably have mentioned it in their diaries.  I therefore conclude that it most likely is not them in the photo.",

They couldn't run back in the direction they came from because that would mean running straight into their pursuers therefore they just kept fleeing further into the jungle while attempting to call emergency services. It was around this time that the deleted photo 509 must have been taken and it was probably a photo of the pursuer(s) They could have hidden in the jungle for days while attempting to call emergency services which would explain the numerous call attempts and they would also most likely have gotten lost at this point. At some point, their pursuer(s) caught up with them or one of them first (Lisanne) and the other one later (Kris) Their were most likely defiled repeatedly before being dismembered. Their organs were probably sold or they were cannibalized by their pursuer(s). The sadistic killer(s) would then have left their belongings neatly for the police to find after deleting photo 509. I doubt the killer(s) were smart enough to know that the image could only be permanently deleted with a computer but I digress. The severed foot and rolled skin must have been some sort of warning or signature. I don't believe that the killer(s) were smart enough to succeed in sending detectives on a wild goose chase. They must have made errors but sloppy investigations by Panama meant that the killer(s) managed to get away with it. A cover-up by Panamanian authorities is also highly likely because them revealing that some serial killers were responsible would have greatly damaged their tourism industry. The truth of it all shall emerge one day because the truth cannot be hidden for long.",

Two men, the other is a bit fat and black. arrested and they refused to be raped then because they refused this they were killed the oralne died because he was hit in the back with a stone and Kris was strangled to death and they were mutilated) the reason is strong because the bag they carry is clean and without stains and 34 fingerprints just to deceive the police seemed to want to point out that the interior tribesmen had killed him. You'll know what a psychopath's job is like. continue On one April after taking a taxi (this taxi driver also saw these two perpetrators when they arrived at their destination) and they accidentally met a psychopath (two local residents) they chatted and in just two hours they became friends and it was as if they had known each other for a long time. . Then they went for a walk at first they just went for a walk around the tourist attractions. (It can be seen from the bag he carried without adequate equipment. And on April 1st they were killed by a psychopath. after death they are raped and then mutilated and the pieces are distributed in various places some are eaten by wild boars and a psychopath alibi to eliminate traces of making strange things with night photos on the victim's camera and photos of orale or kris photographed from afar as if on the second day cris and oralne were still alive and lost and tried to call the police who called the police many times is the culprit) and a separate photo section It was photographed by the perpetrator and who did the murder 1 person even killed more than 5 people one of them was spanish and there was one person who knew more about this murder at first this one didn't know the intent and his friend's goal because this was his friend he couldn't help but get involved. The spirit is in the cave and the victim there is calm and peaceful. This is just my opinion. Peace be upon you, and Allah mercy and blessings",

        "text": "Yes this is long. Shut up and just suck it up and read it, okay? :) I want opinions on my opinion and if it makes sense to you. \n\nI think they both fell by the bridge and Kris’ injuries were more grave and worrisome. I think Lisann being an athlete and slightly behind Kris she probably prepared and angled her body and footing a bit better. So assuming they both fell near the water, maybe the camera was damaged by the stream and had to air out. Lisann likely took care of her dying and concussed friend and took the night pictures days after to mark where they fell and Kris died, but she couldn’t until it had a chance to dry out. Kris’ body was less elevated and in the water where she fell from the bridge worked against her surviving from the get-go, salt. But the camera still being wet and needing time to\ndry out on the rocks could explain the gap; the infamous deleted picture was likely Lisann either taking a pic and then immediately deleting it at night days later so she knew where to place her fingers on the camera to take a photo in the dark — and Lisann was a “shutter bug” so Lisann, albeit for sure likely panicked, still knew how to take, delete  and refocus her camera and its lens. \n\nThe close-up shots are especially pertinent evidence within the scope of their timeframe and underscores the dangerous, important aspect of the timeline of where they were — in particular where Kris — expired first on the watery rocks. Lisann, I’m sure, took photos of Kris and made markings and crossings to lead a trail to her best friend’s broken body. So maybe the camera suffered a technical glitch that wiped that photo away as the last one taken during the night photos on the day they fell. I could see that too, why else would you not take any photos from Day 1 unless you’re: hurt &/or can’t find the camera after the fall, pretty incapacitated because of said fall and maybe 1\nOr both girls were unconscious.\nEven if just 1 is, it’s not like you can ask yourself bestie where the camera is if you’re both suffering broken bones/sprains/concussions, etc etc for days at a time, missing your camera in the bank elevation’s foliage or water/rocks, or needing to dry out the camera due to water. Lisann survived a few extra days because she hadn’t fell as brutally as Kris had. It seems like Kris didn’t see her fall from the bridge as clearly marked so when she fell, I imagine the bra was a tournequit for Kris’ leg/head/what have you and Lisann likely tried to make her comfortable as possible given her injuries. When Lisann fell she had a better chance of minimal pains, breaks or bleeding compared to Kris. However, the weather elements and terrain in Panama is a cruel mistresses to any hikers who dares to enter its misfortunate l for long. Both the women displayed immense courage, solidarity, soul and fight during those agonizing. scary, and painfully long and woesome  dying days that unfairly claimed Kris first and then Lisann. \n\nIf you have any injury that isn’t disinfected and medically cared for fairly\nquickly your chance of surivival isn’t met with a good ratio, especially in the water and the lanscape itself, what with all sorts of bugs and bacteria  to make your ass go into septic shock real quick . But, the resolve Lisann — and Kris both, even after  falling and being rendered unable to move/was incapacitated (in my\nOpinion anyway ) her body drifting in and out of states of successions, delirium,\nunconsciousness, fear, pain, shock, panic —-\nthat both young women genuinely showcased an iron-will absolute in its resolve until their  bitter, twice claimant end. But that kind of  unrelenting nature they speared impresses upon you the type of women — well, *people* really —- that these young women so-clearly and so-loudly, naturally were. And that’s of two bright, promising, gifted lives snuffed out, having been dealt an undeserving fate for them both. RIP",

The girls snap a photo of their killers just prior to their abduction, the missing image, 509. The killers over the next few days do what they're gonna do with the girls and their remains. Then on April 8th, one of the killers, killer 1, starts looking through the camera pics. He notices there's incriminating evidence in pic 509. He hastily deletes it. Killer 2 advises him that deleting the pic doesn't actually delete it; it has to be written over. So killer 1 proceeds to take 99 random photos in the middle of the night in an attempt to [overwrite] deleted pic 509. Killer 2 [or 3 if gang-related] then explains that there's no guarantee he overwrote the entire file, and that it may still be [at least partially] recoverable. Now, for whatever reason, they have already planned to plant the backpack with the phones and camera, etc. [to make it look accidental, possible police cover-up], and really don't want to just smash the camera or its memory card. So instead, they remove the memory card, insert a new one and format it. Then using a computer they copy the contents of the old card onto the new one.

It seems like someone was playing with the camera, albeit, in the dark, and in the jungle. Someone fascinated by her hair color. They're very freaky photos if you look carefully, think of the person taking them, in the dark, and in the rain. I cannot imagine what these girls went through, it's truly heartbreaking. \nAt the end of the day, not enough was done, and prosecutor Betzaida Pitti only cared to sweep this under the rug, which is disgusting. People should be reminded that Panama's government did NOT uphold their responsibility to properly or thoroughly investigate these deaths in order to protect visitors and locals alike. Also, I find it pretty disturbing that Ms. Pitti was one of the authors of the book \"Lost in the Jungle\", which whitewashed their mistakes. It ends by blaming the girls, talking about what they were wearing and such...\nVery unfortunately, I don't think this case will ever be solved. They even messed up Kris's name on the memorial plaque... smh\n\nFor anyone looking for more info on this case. I came across some very detailed articles, one on the website imperfect plan, written by Chris… Idk, he didn't leave a last name, but whoever put that together really went all the way in. They should have been leading the investigation!! There is also a blog written by Scarlet R. on Koude Kaas, titled \"The missing Dutch girls in Panama, Part 2 - the swimming photo\". Where she puts together a whole lot of information about some of the possible causes surrounding the swimming photos, mysterious deaths, etc. Anyway, be safe out there, people, and be kind to one another!",

At night they used the least usefull source of light - the camera flash for a glipse of the terrain on the move. One maybe both got hurt. If the place was populated or so popular somebody would hear them or see camera flash. There is no other reason to take so many pointless photos in the dark with nothing on them. If somebody or something was stalking them it would be visible on at least one. If they was not moving some of the photos would be possible to link to each other. If you are lying down you have 180 degrees to cover and while you are taking photos once in the while you have to cover an area you did before to some extent and most likely you will miss few degrees directly behind you so it makes the chance of connecting photos even higher. The fact there is notbody else on these photos says these was made by leading person. So it definetelly was made for the reason of getting rough idea of terrain in your way. If one of them was hurt badly the second one would definetelly took some pictures as a testimony. They could fall and drown. That is why there is not much of their bones found. And their bag could be found and taken way earlier without any context of the missing people. Later recovered once they found out it could be connected.",

But there are so many irrelevant points brought up that have no significance, presented as crucial pieces of evidence. eg;\n-Who was or wasn't wearing a backpack in which photo - over 4 hours, it's just as likely they just swapped from time to time along the way as they got tired - it doesn't mean anything and has no relation to which direction they were walking in.\n-Why would they stop twice in the same spot to waste storage space to take the same posed selfie pictures in the same place after they've already done it going one way?  A normal person just keeps walking home.  The photos were taken at the same time, in one session.\n-The highly dramatic travel channel documentary took the word of one indigenous man that they were not actually photographed at the Serpentine trail and took it as true gospel over all the other professionals who actually walked the trail searching for them specifically using their camera trail.  He was simply wrong.  That was not a photo of them heading back up the trail home, it was confirmed to be them having passed the \"do not pass\" sign and continuing down on into the deep jungle.  They may well have paid that native chap to say what they wanted him to say.  They even posed at a random stream crossing claiming it proved the girls were going back up the trail home, even though the rock formations were completely different.  They BS'ed that it was different because \"it's a dynamic setting\".  Those large boulders were completely embedded and had been there for likely thousands of years.  No small stream or even raging river will move them, they are fixed and will only be eroded incrementally over hundred of thousands of years.\n-It's claimed often there is no way to get lost on this trail. This is preposterous and even Indigenous inhabitants have died on this trail. After the initial tourist trail half where they stopped to take photos, the trail becomes wild and is for the Indigenous people to use, it is genuinely wild and small with multiple possible tracks becoming available.\n-Speculation about the other people is fine, but people seem to get fixated on the ideas taught to them that these countries are always drug gang murder capitals of the world.  Panama is one of the safest countries in the Americas and that town particularly, even safer.  There is the occasional serious crime like there is in any town but this was shocking for them too.  There is still no evidence that any of those people were there or involved in any way - small town gossip is real and eyewitness accounts of old memories are proven to be virtually no better than guessing.",

        "text": "It is difficult to imagine how the parents and family must feel after so much speculation and absurd theories have been shaping the investigation of this case. There are two key things on this case that we should consider – if we are truly serious about finding answers and more than anything, I hope the relatives assimilate for sake of finding peace.  \n\nFirst, everyone must understand how deep and profound is the mistrust between the native indigenous populations and their neighbours in the developing countries. This relationship varies between countries, but in Central America, the relationship is sometimes openly hostile between many rural indigenous communities and the “westernized” population.\n\nSecond, in Central America, professional, modern, skilled forensic investigation is essentially, nonexistent. I do not mean insufficient; I mean it just does not exist any shred of basic forensic science being developed and run within the people in charge. Not saying there are not many great people fully compromised with justice, I am just saying they are decades behind first world standards. \n\nI can assure you: there are police stations in the developing world where employees do not even know how to take a decent legible fingerprint when booking someone. Some of the people in charge of policing are not even trained! When you talk about rural areas, poor areas, like Boquete, it is even worse. Many just volunteer their time and effort to do good in their community.\n\nLocal people understand this and accept this as normal. That is the reality.\nThere are facts we cannot simply put aside for convenience or to fulfill likes in our you tube feed! (yes, you know who you are).\nWe would not be talking about this tragedy, if the girls would have stay put as soon as they realized they were lost, and if there had been a professional search and rescue team available- first thing in the morning -at the latest. \n\nI honestly believe, the official conclusion is correct. This was an accident but many things do not make sense simply by the fact, that the truth was not told as of when and where- the backpack was found! Why? Because no innocent indigenous person is willing to go to jail, for the sake of the Panamanian tourist industry or simply to help close a case the corrupt and incompetent authority cannot even begin to process! Simply as that! \n\nThe indigenous Nobi are not hiding a crime. I honestly believe they had nothing, nothing to do with the disappearance, more in fact, they would have helped the girls! They simply do not trust the Police. They trust no one outside their community. Police in Panama is more than corrupt! There are no laws in Panama! (even for white collar people and multinational corporations and that is why they operate based in Panama) The indigenous would have been locked up as scapegoats just to appease the Dutch Government. Their logic is this: you found the backpack? You killed these girls. You go to jail. Case closed. Look up on the internet on how police and the government operate in Latin America. Indigenous people are not even considered third class citizens at best, and this is reality, no matter how hurtful this is. It is a real life drama.\n\nTo add to this, the Police botched up the case. As simple as that. And once again, not because they did not want to find the truth, just because police in these parts of the world have no clue on how to run a decent professional investigation. It is the sad reality. I know this, you know this.\n\nWhy do you have so many sets of fingerprints on the camera? Possibly, because there were Nobi hands all over the girl’s things and, because you had many hands playing with everything at the police station! Why can’t you find picture 509 in the memory card? Possibly, because a wise guy at the police station deleted the file while transferring the files by accident? Or even possibly, and this may be something some people will find absurd – but – it may be true as true is that all electronics are not 100% perfect: the card was corrupted or defective and photo 509 is simply photo 510. The card could not process or execute a file titled 509. We cannot simply assume this is not possible. The family may be able to confirm this bay looking up for photo albums taken with this camera.\n\nI venture to think “photo 509” did not exist or was deleted by the police. So, when think about serial killers, a sexual predator, drug trafficking ring, human traffickers…let us get real! It is smore likely you can find one of these in your neighbourhood- or right next door -than in the middle of a jungle in Boquete. I can assure you, Boquete is safer than many neighbourhoods in big cities in Europe and North America. Many people depend on tourism and many live simple and decent lives and have no ill wish to tourists. \n\nWhat happened then? No one will know exactly what happened. I believe eventually more remains will appear, but no one will know for sure. I believe Kris and Lisanne made a few mistakes and then made a heroic and admirable intent to rectify and survive the drama. They started their hike a little late and quite possibly, assumed the trail was some kind of a “loop” and they continued with the hike and eventually became concerned about being lost. There was no accident, imminent danger and that is why there were only two calls that evening. They assumed they could walk out the following day. They continued to walk even farther away from Boquete.  I am sure they thought they would walk out the jungle at some point and – or be found.\n\nSo many assumptions regarding many things. The fishy guide. Why did he go to look for them? Because no party to guide meant no income for the day. They had an arrangement. That is why he went to look up for them. Why did he find the remains? Possibly because those are the trails he walks often as a guide for hikers. Who else knew those trails better than him? He did. His life has been a nightmare ever since. If someone had stalked, attacked, and killed those girls: they would have done the deed early, the phones would not have been found/ used. As simple as that.  \nIt has been stated the frantic photos at night clearly show intent to leave signal of a site. To pinpoint something in the case the camera was found. I believe the camera was used in a state of panic, and confusion after one of the girls passed late at night during rain fall.  The other girl quite possibly kept moving and later also passed on, not far away from where ethe pictures were taken.\n\nI believe, the backpack was left in a ravine or somewhere safe from the rising waters and found very soon after the girls passed. The Nobi kept everything clean and dry for weeks and eventually decided to turn them in to avoid problems after hearing about the lost girls from their community. \n\nSomething everyone seems to be concerned of: why the two bras were in the backpack? How about the shorts? Simple. See, they did not carry only -1- bottle of water. Right? You cannot assume they had only one bottle because only one bottle was found in the backpack, right? I am sure at one point, walking thru a humid and warm jungle they decided to quite possibly remove clothing as convenient and comfortable. Sometimes without the bras, only on tops and sometimes only with the bras or swim trunks.\n\nAnd more importantly: I believe they carried extra clothing as they could have even tried to reach the waterfalls. They carried swimming suits. If you think about this, somethings start to make sense – at least that is my humble take. Why weren’t these found in the backpack? They were wearing the swimming trunks when they perished.\n\nKris’ shorts may have been found in the backpack. I could almost bet on it, but we will never know unless who ever found the things comes up clean. The shorts and the clothing may have even been used by the indigenous for a while. How couldn’t we even dismiss this? \n\nNo one, not you or me would last a week in a jungle, with no water, no food. I believe their remains simply were taken and disposed by wild animals and scattered as they moved thru their habitat.\nWe cannot even imagine how we would have reacted, processed reality while living this nightmare. I truly feel sad for the girls and even more for the parents. Somehow, reading so many absurd stories and people even making money out of this tragedy (yes, that is you Juan Perea) makes me feel upset and I can only hope more people could be have more objectivity while searching truth because finally, we should all be helping these families heal and have peace.",

I also just listened to an Unsolved Mysteries podcast about this topic and there is nothing tangible to suspect anyone of foul play. \n\nOne of the \"suspicious\" points is the deleted photo. For sake of argument, let's say that photo was incriminating for the murderer. Two questions arise: 1) how/why did someone take ~90 photos 7 days later? 2) Why wouldn't the killer have just destroyed the camera? This was a camera, not a camera phone so there wouldn't be any cloud storage so destroying it would leave no trace of what happened. \n\nThe other \"suspicious\" point is the failed phone login attempts on the 7th - 10th. My theory for this is Lisanne was trying to get into Kris' phone because Lisanne's phone was dead (last used on the 5th) and Kris was either dead or unconscious.\n\n\nHere is my theory for what happened:\nDay 1: Hiking as planned. Possibly they deleted a photo immediately after taking it because it was blurry or something. At some point, one of the girls, probably Kris, gets hurt and they can't find the trail again. If they fell down a cliff, they wouldn't be able to get back up easily and would have lost track of the dog. Even experienced adventurers tend to act irrationally after getting lost. \nDays 2-6: Continue to wander lost in the jungle. The rains started during this time so they were able to drink from streams to keep themselves alive, but likely got sick from parasites in the water. \nDay 7: Kris dies from a fall off of the bridge. Lisanne frantically tries to guess Kris' pin but is unsuccessful.\nDay 8: With no phone access, Lisanne uses camera flashes to try to light the way. This could have also been when a photo was deleted immediately after it was taken.\nDays 9-11: Lisanne tries to find her way back alone while occasionally trying to guess Kris' pin but eventually succumbs to exhaustion, starvation, or dehydration.\nNext 2 months: The girls' remains are scattered around by animals and flowing water.",

You take a photo and then review the photo, kinda makes sense. I don't think they should have been moving at night at all though, they should have tried to make some kind of camp and moved in daylight.",

If it had been the girls making that call, don't you think they'd have stayed at that spot and tried calling over and over again? But no - no further calls. b) a camera with them and no photos are taken for a week before the mystery night photos? Unlikely. c) no messages, either written, audio or video are left. Again, unlikely. d) naive these girls may have been but stupid they weren't. they would be unlikely to venture deep into the jungle once they reached the summit. Far more likely to turn back. All this plus the issues with the backpack/clothing/physical remains evidence points fair and square to foul play, not a \"lost in the jungle\" scenario.",

N'allez pas me faire croire au vue du nombre de faits dans cette région qu'il s'agit de quelqu’un d'autre que ceux qui vivent sur ce lieu. D'autres ossements sont retrouvés mais tout le monde s'en fout, une femme et un enfant, ça ne pose pas question ?\nJe ne sais pas qui est l'auteur de ce carnage mais je suis convaincu que tout le monde sait car avec le temps les langues se délient et la vérité éclate. Elle est souvent sous nos yeux mais on continue de douter de nos intuitions qui sont souvent proche de la réalité. La page du guide sur un site de référencement spécialisé est curieuse. La première photo date de 2012, après il y a des photos de 2014, l'année de ce double meurtre ( + viol probablement, la présence des soutifs dans le sac à indices soigneusement déposé sur un rocher est une évidence). Les premières photos de 2014 sont de février et jusqu'en juin (mois de la trouvaille des indices des villageois) il n'y a aucunes nouvelles photos. Après les photos sont de plus en plus partagées au fil des mois et des années, le guide semble avoir percé, il est encore en activité apparemment. Je ne suis pas certain que le guide soit le meurtrier mais il sait quelque chose. Ils se connaissent probablement tous sur les berges de cette rivière du serpent. Le tourisme ne doit pas s'arrêter pour quelques dérapages de locaux, on couvrent l'affaire et le temps se chargera de faire oublier dans l'esprit des gens, qu'un ou des psychopathes vivent au bord de la rivière du serpent de Boquete et que de temps en temps ils décident de sacrifier des touristes pour assouvir des désirs honteux",

But I find it strange (for those who know the whole story of the case) that, right after the last photo taken in a small stream, the girls didn't take any more photos or use their cell phones for 3 hours. Kris's father, in the video \"Answers by Kris,\" who hiked the trail with Feliciano (the guide) and Kris's mother, claimed that up to the point where they went—which, according to their calculations of hiking distances, would be the closest point to where the girls made the emergency call—it wasn't so easy to get lost. They would only get lost if they left the trail. And they didn't have a logical explanation for the girls doing that, because they weren't taking any more photos in that section. There was no obvious reason to leave the trail and get lost. Looking at the whole case, it seems the girls simply got lost. But the strange thing, which even Kris's father comments on in this video, is: Why didn't they take more photos during that 3-hour hike since the last photo, before making the first emergency call?",

        "text": "I'm surprised you didn't notice anything odd with Kris's photos especially. Most of the early shots she's happy and excited but towards the latter, you can easily tell she's distraught, not smiling and obviously not having any fun. The one where she's at the creek looking back you can easily point out there's no excitement and zero happiness which can lead one to believe they've been caught by person's of interest as they're the ones taking the pictures. The photo showing Kris's hair at 7:04 is actually the top front of her head. You can easily see her nose at the bottom and, if you blow it up, her deadened eyes. There actually exists two photos like the one at 7:04 where her mouth is wide open as if she's gasping for air while being choked. The choking was pointed out by several sources as you can (again blowing up that photo) notice a black thumb right by her mouth. That rock with plastic and twigs is actually from the Caldera Hot Springs where Kris and Lisanne were seen in a photo with Jose Murgas and Osman Valenzuela. Both were members of Henry Gonzales's gang (the son of Feliciano who had a dire lust for Dutch women). Osman died three days after the girls' disappearance from an apparent drowning (deemed homicide) .. Jose a year later by a hit and run. The girls didn't get lost on the trail as numerous witnesses noticed them coming back into town hours later only to be picked up by a red truck. Case grew cold only followed by several theories after that. \n\nAll of this was a cover up to protect the tourist attraction that makes the majority of Boquete's economy run as the investigation by Betzaida Pitty mishandled key evidence. Why wasn't Feliciano and his property ever investigated? How is it possible that Dutch cadaver dogs (who can sense decay for up to 6 miles) couldn't sense anything yet Feliciano just happened to stumble upon their bones as well as several others from different people? How is it possible that their non-waterproof backpack wasn't waterlogged with everything inside damaged after spending weeks in the jungle? Everything was dry and neatly folded / placed inside on top of a rock.. last I checked heavy river currents don't fold laundry. The backpack was nearly pristine.. material sitting in the jungle for weeks would have succumbed to the elements; that much is evident. Their bones would have had animal marks but they were unmarked, perfectly bleached and clean.. hmmm..  I know we'll never see the light of day with this case because the right people were paid off while the loose ends were all dealt with.",

Was the backpack in an overall good condition, for allegedly being out there, in the forest - exposed to the environment for months? How?\n\nIf there was a foul play involved- the phone calls - a local person can make 911 phone calls, especially when he knows, there’s no signal anyway. Just do it for a few days, to make it look like they were alive, looking for help.\n\nAs for photos - if there are legit photos of them days after being lost, that’s weird. The photos in the dark, again, anyone could have taken them for any reason.\n\nIf you’re a killer, you probably don’t want people to know it, you make up “evidence” - phone calls days after they could have been dead, photos of weird things - they’re lost, starving, paranoid, take weird pictures, why not. \n\nIf someone harvested their organs - why bleach their bones though- and if that’s something you do, why return these particular bones to be found? \n\nDid they just get lost and died - probably. But phone calls, backpack found - that doesn’t have to mean anything - especially if you want to make it look, like they got lost and you’ve gained something far better than a couple of bras, phones and $80. \n\nIf they were taking genuine photos of themselves afterwards, I haven’t seen those, why would you do that, why not record a video for the family instead, I don’t know.",

        "text": "First of all, whatever the reason was, it's terrible what happened to them 😢. It must be so horrible to know you last days are counting knowing you gonna die within a short time. Why did they go in there?\n\nBut... If it was a wild animal (one of the theory's) who attacked them, how was Lisanne escaped and survived the attack? It's unlikely to escape a wild animal as a human being, and take photo's of your injured or dying friend after an attack of a wild animal. Lisanne would be killed as well on the same moment. But maybe im wrong.\n\nIm so affraid they were murdered by a creep. Because, if a wild animal would have killed them, all body parts should be at the same place. A wild animal don't take many body parts to different places. A human being can. It's the only rational theory who can explain the sepperation of body parts. Who else could do that then a \"human\" (read psychopath) being, toghetter in mind with the last photo's with Kris standing near a waterfall being concerned and holding her injured head?  The last two full photo's can mean one thing:\n\nA psychopath noticed and mistreating them head injuries at first to force them pretending nothing was wrong, but the face of Kriss was very concerned and she seems scared of the photographer somehow. And 23:10 the cable bridge is edited with stripes that do not match the distance and size comparised with the left photo, and there is no bridge visible in the dark without the edited lines.\n\nBut still then, how became the body parts in different places? That's not a natural cause, not even after wild animal attacks.\n\nI think it's the youth gang. There were more people missing, and even men where found dead in the same area. A strong man probably could fight one attacker, but if you fight with 5 people at 1 person, you can't survive that easy. I think it is the gang.\n\nI feel so sorry still, and forever, for their parents and their friends, as well for themselves living in fear the last days. Very warmhearted girls who only wannts to help other people. Why?\n\nRest in peace sweet Kris and Lisanne 🥀🥀😭",

When i was young, i do not comprehend the severity of getting lost in the jungle, and i also though \"its jus 100 meters in front, how can i get lost?\" and guys, amateur hikers when panic kicks in is surreal, its like the fear creeps in bcos every tree and river looks like the path u jus pass through. Also, mysterious stories of ppl lost in jungle is almost always add on by many theories, mostly i tink its fictional. Lets keep it simple unless real evidence shown.\n\nBasicaly, naive, lost, panic, inexperience, predator, left too soon, god bless 🙏\n\nMy condolences to the friends and family of the deceased.",

It is believed that the girls heard them but could not respond due to weakness or because they were injured, so they took photos out of nowhere to get the attention of the lifeguards with the flash. There is a photo showing letters created with toilet paper, which is believed to say SOS, and a mirror. That would be because they would see the rescue helicopters passing by looking for them.",

        "text": "My heart literally aches to see Kris' Mother face. As a parent, it is unimaginable to comprehend the pain she must feel. I would do the same as her, revisit the trail whenever possible and continue the search for answers. Deep appreciation to all those involved in this video, as it is very helpful as I try to understand this unexplained tragedy. At first glance, I would speculate something important happened about the time of the last photo. Something caused the 2 ladies to either rush further down the trail, or possibly seek cover by veering off the trail (and subsequently become lost). I agree completely with Kris' mother; the two would not have left the trail haphazardly. There are too many unanswered questions to make serious conclusions about the events that took place after the last photo, but the fact they began making emergency calls about 2-3 hours after the picture at the creek tells me (1) they were likely not abducted at that time and (2) they realized they needed help, i.e., they were probably lost. So, my best guess is they left the trail for unknown (but important) reasons and (2) subsequently became lost and (3) likely wandered through the forest, finally finding the small river below and spent the next couple weeks in that area and probably tried exploring upstream in search of help/civilization. Based on everything else I have read, I would guess that they encountered a person or people while near the river who turned out to have criminal intent. The backpack was relatively undisturbed, apparently, and suggests that the 2 had set it aside as they bathed but then were either abducted or for some reason suddenly left it behind. The fact that the camera and cell phones were in the pack tells me the people responsible for harm were not sophisticated in nature. I have further speculations as to what happened, but I have extended my hypothesis beyond what is reasonable already. My sincerest condolences to the families, and thanks to all the wonderful volunteers from Panama who have tried to help.",

If i had a wire bra on in this same situation, it'd have been torn off and tossed in the woods (but really in my backpack because I'm not a litterbug) within the first 12 hours. I personally find bras are more for other people's comfort or enjoyment rather than the wearer. My super big boob friends also feel the same way...(lower boobs put less weight on the back...lower center of gravity. Mile higher boobs force the upper spine to bear the most weight. Plus it's consolidated.\n\n\nSo anyway, I'm sorry for what happened to these girls. At least they didn't choose to suffer in bras.\n\nAnd also... I'm not going to elucidate too much into my hacking skills here, but I've got a few decades experience in deleted file recovery as well as photography. I'm with kendall, photo 509 is probably a regular disk error of some kind. If someone were going through the trouble to delete a photo beyond recovery....just ditch the whole thing. By trying to remove it, you're more likely to leave a digital trail. The memory card would have recorded a hidden file linking it to the device it was connected to. And i highly doubt someone would have even thought to do that if they only thought to delete a picture blah blah blah.\n\nIf a device overheats, experiences a power inconsistency, if the camer gets turned off while trying to take a picture (night pictures are delayed even with flash while the camera tries to focus on a subject in the dark preflash).\n\nI can always be wrong but i think these little things distract from the big picture.\n\nRIP",

The photos would catch a still of something moving before it got a chance to hide and give them a chance to observe the photo to see if they captured the target scaring them.",

It was surmised that it was Kris Kremers that sustained a head injury, and when this story first was covered in the news, I did see the actual photo of the injury, but that was 3 years ago, and at the request of her family, was removed and I can't find it anywhere now. So, after seeing that, it's known she had some injury to her head, and being out in the jungle without food or water, you aren't going to last long. I think she may have fallen into one of those ravines and Lisanne couldn't get her out, so stayed with her waiting for help. Based on the weather reports for that day, the first real storm of the rainy season began on the 8th of April, the same night the photos were taken in darkness. When it rains up there in the cloud forests, it comes down hard and fast-which I believe  caused the ravine Kris was in to fill with water and eventually turned into a raging stream capable of drowning the injured girl, and Lisanne could have been using the cameras flash as a desperate attempt to see the water level. Then, after realizing she could no longer help her friend may have tried to cross that monkey bridge and fell in and drowned as well. Even if a stream or creek doesn't look too bad, anytime it's running fast from rainwater is a dangerous time. Although I don't believe either one was dragged through the river, if their bodies were in it, it would've helped speed up decomposition with fish and other predators and eventually broke their bodies down and that would explain why they only found a small amount of remains. As for Lisannes foot being in the boot still, that is because she was wearing them when she died. The boot would've helped keep her foot intact longer, and prevented animals from getting at it to a point. I've read about plain crashes and explosions where they can't find anyone's remains, but will come across a shoe with the foot still in it. And the camera, I have one identical and it was inadvertently left outside all summer, fall,  and most of the winter and where I live, it can be 100°F in summer and -35°F in winter which was that year and had gotten rained and snowed on and when I found it I figured it was shot, but I hoped since it was still in its case that that might very well have saved it. And luckily it did, and I still use that camera to this day. A bit different from a jungle type climate, but still extreme heat and cold and water damage , and yet it still worked and all my photos were on the memory card. So I just think they had an awful amount of bad luck and bad timing. So very sad, but I don't think anyone made them disappear.",

Here are my thoughts from that video:\n\nEverything points to foul play: from delayed investigations, to ignored evidence, culminating in rushed conclusions. \n\n\r\n\r\nOf special note, are the camera images supposedly used to communicate a message, and that \"one deleted photo\" which probably contained the face(s) of the perpetrator(s). In the latter case, the photo has been deleted professionally, to the point that you cannot recover it, someone used relatively sophisticated means to erase it; some have said that the members of the tribe that found the belongings deleted it for good, which is quite impossible (after all, tribes that live in the middle of nowhere aren't exactly high-tech savy), I repeat, you need advanced software to eliminate it, without damaging the rest of the photos. The other photos were probably taken and left intact, to fool people into thinking it was a freak wilderness expedition accident.\n\n\r\n\r\nAnd most importantly, if the girls got lost on their own and actually wanted to communicate what happened to them... do you think they wouldn't have the brains to write a message on mud or soil, or with pieces of clothes, or with leaves, or rocks, or sticks, or anything, so that they could then take a picture of the message, to tell us exactly what had happened to them? Another possibility, is that they didn't have time to write such messages, because they were being chased by a person, considering that what remained of them has no sign of animal attacks.\n\n\r\n\r\nTheir disappearance was, undoubtedly, the act of a criminal group, with solid connections.",

        "text": "Here is my theory based on few known facts and some speculation:\nWe know that they started hiking around 11am and they would've summited around 3 and returned to  the starting point around 5pm or so. I also saw in another video that the host family dog went with them.\n\nBased on the girls' personalities, it was almost impossible for them to do something rash unless emergencies happended(their excessive planning tendencies).\n\nThe guide, Feliciano is still guiding people on this trail according to alltrails and he is quiet popular. We knew that he went in the girl's room and checked on them which is soemwhat weird considering that he was denied on being their tour guide?\n\nWe knew that there was one picture deleted in their photos. Why was only one photo deleted? It seems somewhat weired to stop and just delete one photo.\n\nThe Dutch rescue team searched almost the entire mountain and found nothing. The backpack and body parts weren't found until two weeks later and the bones were bleached. Somehow one of the girl's bones decomposed faster than the other and one of them sustained an injury after she died.\n\nSo here is my theory:\nOn the day the two girls went hiking, they were dropped off by the taxi driver around 11, the two summited but realized someone was following them, they tried to escape the follower(s) so they kept going but were eventually caught up. They could've sustained a fall with one of them, or it could be caused by traumatic injuries by the culprit at different time frames. There are private propertis up on the trail likely invoved with the local gangs. They were locked up in a cabin of some sort, likely suffered abuse with no cells signals(as there are claims on alltrails as to gps and signals non existent). Pictures were taken to make it look like they were lost in a jungle and wanted to use the flashlights to find their way. Then, they were evetually bleached and disposed.\n\nFew more additional notes: dog returned to the lodging by end of the day, there were comments about the tour guide being creepy to european females(perhaps tour guide tipped off locals?), taxi driver was killed so there could be some mistake with the timeline.",

The host and camera man actually went and re created the path they had taken including the exact locations two of the photos were taken. The most interesting part of the episode though was the interview with the lady and her husband that found the back pack. According to the both of them a photo that was thought to have bin taken hours after they got lost past the great divide was actually somewhere before the great divide meaning they never went past the great divide but instead turned around and at some point for whatever reason got taken off the path. The wife and husband that retrieved the back pack have to be extremely familiar with that path especially to make such a bold statement as to state the photo was with no doubt somewhere before the great divide.",

        "text": "It is clear that it was a crime, a crime still without clarification, let's hope that the case will be reopened and the perpetrator (s) will be found. The backpack with still operational content, such as cell phone memories and the camera, is an important element when ruling out a fortuitous accidental event. Probably, the victims were intercepted before the last photographic take and both the cell phones and the camera were no longer in their possession. The emergency calls that were made and that did not succeed are only a distracting element to confuse the authorities, since if it had been in the hands of the victims, they would have recorded photographic shots, filming or audio recordings of what was happening, in addition to trying to communicate to ask for help. In the event of an accident or that they had been lost, it is impossible to think that they would stop taking photos, in several days of loss and agony. Lost and alone they would end up talking to the camera. The erratic photographs taken at dawn were not taken by the victims, but rather the result of a distracting action to confuse the police, or of an act of remembrance, which is why it is probably after the death of the victims. The conserved backpack is initially a trophy of the author, for that reason it conserves the bras of both victims, but for some reason, probably to reinforce the idea of ​​a fortuitous accident, it is placed to be found. Everything missing, especially bones, are trophies that the predator keeps.\r\nThe predator, in this case, is an educated person, a planner, who probably speaks the language of the victims, has no economic motivation, his motivations seem to be basically to inflict pain and terror on the victims, there seems to be some sexual component.",

There were 3 hours in between.\n \nHow can we say without any doubt that these girls were STILL there ?\n\nMy hypothesis is that they have already turned back at 508 ( last daytime photo location) and spent approximately 2 hours walking back to the trail head. Then they were picked up by a red truck ( no taxi available) and drove in the direction of the Caldera.  2+1=3 hours. \n\nThese Dutch girls were either abducted or murdered inside a village house in the area. No photoshopping has been done but the sequence has been changed.\n\nMy theory :  foul play by the gang.",

Je pense qu'elles ont essayé de laisser des traces en prenant des photos, pour envoyer des signaux. On comprend vraiment qu'elles voulaient survivre/être repérées, voir autour d'elles la nuit et essayer de retrouver leur chemin. Les pauvres elles ont dû être si désorientées... \n\nJ'ai aussi pensé à un animal sur la photo où on voit les fameux cheveux, mais je n'arrive pas à voir les détails c'est trop perturbant (sûrement les réglages en pleine nuit de l'appareil photo dans une jungle c'est jamais vraiment net et il y a tellement de possibilités ?). En tout cas on peut vraiment tout imaginer :/ \n\nL'histoire est vraiment horrible et mystérieuse, par contre je crois à 1000% en la théorie de l'hélicoptère qui passait au-dessus d'elles, avec la photo pointant vers le ciel qui aurait été supprimée par la police. Le tourisme est tellement massif là-bas ça fait vraiment une différence dans l'économie du pays, je pense qu'ils n'auraient pas voulu prendre de risques... L'histoire a dû freiner beaucoup de touristes et causer beaucoup de difficultés aux gérants de ce programme",

Si il ne restait plus que Lisanne, pourquoi n'a-t-elle clairement pas pris une photo du corps de Kris et des alentours pour montrer où il était avant de partir chercher les secours ? \nEt pourquoi n'ont elles pas réessayé de contacter les secours avec le téléphone de Kris puisqu'il restait de la batterie (même si Lisanne n'avait pas le code, ce qui semble tout de même peu probable, elle aurait pu utiliser la fonction appel d'urgence qui ne nécessite pas le code) ? \nEt pourquoi n'ont elles pas essayé de baliser leur chemin avec les affaires qu'il y avait dans leur sac plutôt que de tout laisser dans le sac ? \nJe ne comprends pas non plus pourquoi les ossements de Kris sont propres, ni pourquoi tous les os ne sont pas ensemble (je veux bien qu'il y ait des animaux mais on aurait retrouvé plus d'os, même aux alentours). \nEnfin, trop de questions sans réponse à mon goût...",

Lisane stayed with her and when Kris died she tried to get help but also got injured maybe also fell off that bridge.She left clues for the researchers such as Kris pants, rolls of paper miror, the branch with the red bags but the rescue team obviously never passed the monkey bridge. She also took many photos of the injured body of Kris, the family saw the photos and requested not to be publiced. It was Lisane who tried to call. It was an accident guys. NO MYSTERY HERE.",

        "text": "I’ve always thought that the guide was extremely suspicious. Why would he go to their room the next day, only because they hadn’t met him as scheduled? That makes zero sense. The normal thing to do would have been to call them, and if he didn’t even try to call them, that’s not normal. \n\nIf  tourists don’t show up for a guided tour, the  tour guide might try to call, but if they can’t get through, they shrug their shoulders and would then go about his or her day. Who would go to where they were staying and GET KEYS to enter their room-and snoop around it for a half hour? \n\nThey were obviously young, naive and an easy target. If someone knew where to look for them on the trail, they would have been convenient prey. It seems very unlikely that so many things went wrong and this  was all coincidental. \n\nLater, finding the backpack with their things still conveniently in it in working condition is too bizarre. The phones, and then the camera and that one  missing photo, randomly deleted is absolutely  suspect. The weird way that their bone fragments were located, plus Lissane’s skin being found later on, all fails to add up. \n\nI don’t think that 2 young girls, ill equipped for a long hike and who were  unfamiliar with their surroundings would have been tempted to go off trail so far into the jungle unless something/someone was pursuing them.  They were trying for get away from something and it wasn’t an accidental mistake. \n\nThe cover up has been filled with red herrings and senseless information to throw people off, like the dog Blue, who is in none of the pictures, and probably didn’t join them. The cab driver saying that he dropped them off so late in the day also doesn’t make sense. I don’t think they would start a hike that late when they had no idea how long it might take to get there and back-especially dressed as they were, without jackets or extra clothing, \n\nThe ONLY logical conclusion to me is that they were pursued and subsequently caught and the evidence that turned up later was all planted. It’s very horrible and sad. but I don’t believe that they wandered around for 10 days and then took a bunch of weird pictures but never thought of writing goodbye text messages to their parents or friends. The picture of Kris’ hair was probably taken by someone else after she was dead. RIP Kris & Lissane! I’m sorry that we don’t know what happened, but it definitely is not the official story",

        "text": "I've been watching several vids about the topic. Personally I think it went like this: they wanted to go to swim in the nearby waterfall, which they found out about online when looking for things to do in boring little village while waiting for their volunteering work to start. They packed light back bag for swimming: little bit water, some cash and bikinis. After all, they were planning to hike a bit, have a swim and come back in the evening. They hiked the trail to the top of the mountain and then tried to find to the waterfall nearby. They left the path confidently and descended, but couldn't return back to the trail because it was too steep or one of them got injured while descending the mountain. They tried to call emergency services for help. Call didn't get through. Sun was setting and they panicked. They tried to go around to the mountain to get back to track quickly, but lost the sense of direction. They tried to scream for help, the locals didn't want to get involved as they thought someone was being murdered and didn't want to get into trouble themselves. Night photos were either an attempt to gather attention of the rescue helicopter which they heard or a predator like big cat was pursuing them and they tried to scare it away. So they used the flash of the camera for this. As for the backbag. I think some local found the bag and picked it up. They tried to open the phone so they could use it, but they didn't guess the right PIN code. After the whole situation escalated, they must have heard about the incident on the news. Being scared of probability of being accused of murder, the local returned their possessions to be found. They didn't want to incriminate themselves, so they took it far from their dwellings. Maybe eventually the big cat caught them. Being exhausted, dehydrated and confused they were easy pray. I think they stopped taking photos to conserve the battery if they needed. If they were scared and confused, I don't think the first thing they want to do is take selfies. I've gotten myself lost in a jungle and it's very scary how fast the sun sets in jungle. You can almost see the sun going down. Panic hits pretty fast when you realise you have only 10 to 15 mins before it's completely black.",

If so, they were taken trying to go back and being close to successfully going back. Or they were abducted and if so the rocks are found far off both trails.  Because why else would they end up so far off both these trails? They knew when to go back and when the sun sets.  This is as far as they'd have gone by their own will before  returning home. Also, can the night photos be lightened in Photoshop to see better? Because I  can't see much  in them. If they weren't found on the way back (have they looked for traces or DNA in  sheds,  homes and any cave?) despite seemingly heading back,  they must have been forced somehow to continue further and probably off track since the last photo. I've read that the search for the girls started after about a day or 2 after the disappeared. They should have been found during that search if they were simply lost. Because they couldn't have gone very far if they were lost.  Or was the search not more than a few people walking by foot? Even if the girls were only lost,  why did they die when there is fresh water and probably fruits to eat? If they fell or got bitten by a snake,  they would have been found.  If they starved,  still easy to find them.  No reason to end up shattered like that.",

They were apparently kidnappers in human trafficking. None of these gang members were a doctor/surgeon. They had to contact Vega Loukao Moises who could put Henry Eliezer Gonzalez in contact with Edwin Aguirre who had connections to the Costa Rica and Bocas del Toro cartels dealing with human organ trafficking. Henry Gonzalez botched the first plan of selling the women by delaying the delivery of the women alive to Plinio Montenegro.  Second reason, the lungs are protected by the rib cage. It takes a surgeon's skill and surgeon tools to remove the rib cage and lungs without damaging the lungs and carefully cutting the arteries to and from the heart as well as the airway (Trachea and Bronchi). Any removed organs require to be packed in ice in a cooler for transport. It is critical to keep the lungs uncontaminated (sterile). If Henry Gonzalez was to provide lungs he would have to have a doctor who could do this in the area. The doctor would have to be an accessary to this crime or forced against his will. Because Henry botched his deal to sell the women, he most likely had killed them as he would not let them go. This case has broken the hearts of many who want to see justice. But where human life is cheap there is no justice.  There have been too many rape/murders of women and human slavery even here in Canada. (Job chapter 14, Hebrew Scriptures, Old Testament, Holy Bible. May our Creator give to us and the families of Lisanne and Kris, hope, peace and justice through his coming Heavenly Kingdom.)",

        "text": "So for the rash of pictures being taken in the dark that tells me that (A), they didn't have a light source but they badly needed to see something and (B) something was scaring them in the dark and they were flashing pictures to use the flash of the camera to try and get a visual. As for the missing picture I have to go into a somewhat lengthy explanation to help show why I'm fairly confident that this was foul play and looking at the area I'm willing to bet Coca farmers did something awful to these girls.\n   So the way some operating systems work in regards to deleting a file is based on how they index them. Think of the old days at a library. If you want to find a certain book you checked the card catalog which is an index. Computer Operating systems work the same way. When you delete a file it's not actually gone. What happens is the computer simply deletes the record of that file in it's index (and allows the space that file is stored in on the hard drive to be writable again so that other files can be written over the non-indexed file).. That's like destroying a card inside a card catalog at your library. The book is still on the shelves. Now no one can find it unless they stumble onto it by accident. For that picture to have gone missing completely it means someone who had basic computer skills purposely wiped it. It's probably not a feature built into the camera. If the camera does have that ability then the girls might have just missed clicked in their panic to get light but I highly doubt this. I think camera manufacturers would diliberately not allow a feature like that so their customers didn't accidentally destroy irreplaceable photos. I have a feeling these two girls stumbled into cartel territory where they were either harvesting or even manufacturing coca paste for distribution. I speculate coke traffickers just becuase Panama has been a haven for coke traffickers since the early 80's. I'm fairly confident it was foul play at the bare minimum. As for the other three human remains found there this sounds like hikers who stumbled onto the wrong area of the jungle and cartel members didn't want any lose ends. Especially knowing that a reward of $30,000 USD wasn't enough to get anyone to come forward. People who take poverty over $30,000 USD tend to make that decision out of fear. Cartels are amazing at generating fear. The remains were scattered becuase in order to carry a human corpse through the jungle you need to dismember it or you're not going to get very far in a decent amount of time. A group of guys dismembered the bodies and took them out into different parts of the jungle and tossed them.",

But it is obvious that the girls kept walking onwards, after they reached the summit not back to the city, at least till 2pm, which was the time the last photo was taken. You can see that from the video when the parents walked the same path, but it is mysteries after this point. If they walked back to the town, they would be there around 5pm assuming that they had no break which is impossible, I guess. Most likely it was about to getting dark and they got in the car of someone who might be familiar to them (the son of the guide or pharmacist), before it would get dark. It is also very possible that they were attacked in the forest, but one thing is for sure which is the involvement of a third party. I wish so much that soon or late justice is served for their parents🙏",

        "text": "I will put forward my speculative theory because what happened to these girls is a common occurrence where I live. It happens so often that I just cannot unsee its glaring presence in this case.\nThere are gangs that operate in popular tourist spots and they especially target and kidnap solo travelling female tourists of young age (male tourists are usually avoided because kidnapping them causes much complications. So having even one guy in your tour group will theoretically save you from traffickers). The motive of kidnapping is usually related to pr*stituion or organ trade. The information about such vulnerable tourists is leaked by the tour guides and people in the hospitability industry (in return for money or debt deduction or free drugs). I suspect the host mother of the house where the girls were living because she must have judged the girls to be naive easy targets and reported this piece of information up the chain. This also explains why she didn't bother to inform the authorities about the disappearance. She made the most cliché excuse I have heard in my life. You want me to believe that two young girls all alone in a foreign country with no one to protect them didn't come back by the time they were supposed to and you, being a woman yourself didn't feel concerned for their safety? Didn't bother to check up on them or even call them or their family? I call BS. \nHere's what I think happened to these girls. The information about their hiking trip was somehow leaked to the kidnappers. They must have dispatched someone to lure the girls out of the trail. They usually hire young, hot, local (exotic) guys to do the luring (who doesn't want to hook up with attractive local guys on a trip abroad, right?). Must have been an easy job to track the girls because the trail had limited, predictable scope. The predator/predators must have befriended the girls on their hiking trip, tricked the naïve girls into thinking they would be shown some of the exotic spots off the trail (or invited to a beach-side villa to attend a exotic party). The girls, none the wiser, followed the predator/predators on a hike to wherever they wanted to take them. This explains why the girls' initial photos seem normal.\nNow, why would the kidnappers randomly litter the girls' bones only to be found by the authorities. My guess is that they did it to end the investigation for good. It's because the gangs that operate on that level are usually deeply involved with the authorities. In order to close the case, they needed just enough evidence but not their entire bodies, or it would complicate the investigation. \nThe girls must have sensed something's wrong so they secretly kept calling 112 whenever they could while trying their best to pretend to appear normal before the predator and his friends. They must have also switched off their phones to save battery. \nAs for what was there in Image 509, you guessed it... the picture of the damn heartthrob or his friends. Every bit of information was deliberately left on their phones to help close the case as mere accident. The kidnappers were definitely getting hints from the authorities in order to be able to fabricate stuff with such finesse. \nWhere I live, the gangs usually kidnap vulnerable female tourists from Russia, Thailand and various other countries, make them reliant on drugs and then employ them in brothels. The local authorities know about this and do nothing to stop it. One of my friends spent just $100 to spend a night with a poor Russian woman in a brothel (because he is an idiot and deserves karmic justice). She knew English and told him in tears everything she had to go through which brought her where she was. She also shared similar stories about other females from various countries in a similar situation as her. They all had come happily as tourists and now stay imprisoned as hoes. Their only mistake was to come alone and got targeted for it.\nThe issue is that these gangs are way too powerful in the places where they operate. You cannot escape from them or call for help, or they will kill you and make you disappear from the face of the earth, just like the two girls in this story.",

Also, I cannot believe that on such a sunny day there were none other hikers or tourists to have met the girls on the Pianista Trail. Too strange. And where is the dog the restaurant owner mentioned followed the girls ?  She lied .\n My theory is : Kris and Lisanne either have never been there or have returned and then lured to somewhere else by a gang where they were finally killed. \nThat place is called Caldera Hotspring.

There is so much evidence pointing to him being the murderer it’s sickening. And then to see him with the parents using the machete which was probably used to kill the girls it’s just sickening. Also, I would really like to know what he was telling Domingo not to say anything about…karma will catch up with him and it will not be forgiving and rightfully so. They probably didn’t stop to take photos bc they were concentrating on trying to get to the top of the next mountain in hopes that they would then have cell service. My guess is that they probably thought the top of the next mountain was closer to get to (and thus easier since we now have one with injured foot) so that is why they didn’t just turn around. They more than likely w/o realizing thought that this would be easier and or faster to get to given their position (location) and not caring to stop for photos bc they just wanted to get help. Unfortunately when they got to the top they had no service there either and at this point it was probably getting late and now one of the girls is injured with a fracture to her foot so I’m sure panic started to set in. I truly believe even had it been the next day they would’ve made it back eventually with injury and all had they not been intercepted by Filipiano aka tour guide who even just admitted that he was at that exact location on April 3rd the exact date! So now not only is there a sh*t ton of evidence pointing to him he has no put himself at the exact location as well! Wow how is this still “unsolved” this is bs that he hasn’t been charged bc it’s more than obvious ESPECIALLY now that he has said he was at that spot and “didn’t see anything or anyone” I’m calling bs and major bs!",

The river shattered and evaporated their bones but left their backpack with electronics in good condition? There was still water in the bottle and food in the backpack but you're telling they where starving and dehydrated? You can't have it both ways. \n\nYou don't have proof of life after the 1st. The night photos are a huge mindfuck to throw the timeline off and create the narrative they where lost and still alive by the 8th. The camera data was also tampered with and photo #509 conveniently missing in between the last day photos on the 1st and the last night photos on the 8th.",

Hence the very brief connection. Because non of those calls or photos make any logical sense whatsoever.  As for the photo of Kris’s hair, that could have been taken at any time when, and if the girls had been abducted and she had already died. \nAs for the photos of Kris on her own in the stream etc, by that time they were probably tired and becoming ‘snippy’ with each other (I know, I’ve done it) and didn’t feel like any more jolly selfies. Kris distances herself from Lisanne and, in a moment of reconciliation, Lisanne shouts to her friend ‘hey, Kris’ and snaps the photo. Hence, perhaps Kris’s rather grumpy expression. \nJust my two pennorth worth.",

Why didn't the uninjured girl leave with the dog to get help, or why didn't they keep the dog with them? What were their last moments like? Why didn't they record themselves, if something had happened? Were the flash photos to alert someone, and if so, why are they mostly pointed at the ground? Or were they to scare away animals, or find their bearings? How did they survive for 10+ days in the search area but were not found? What animal scattered their bones - a scavenger, or a predator?",

Whenever there is a disappearance and people don't have an immediate answer, they're too quick to say, \"oh just an accident.\" However, I'm glad that this video makes it clear that it could have been an accident or it could have not been one at all. The man interviewed around roughly 30 mins does an excellent job of highlighting the suspicion of a single deleted photo. As he so cleverly notes, if you're lost in the woods and desperate, the last thing you're doing is going far out of your way to delete a single photo. Heck, I personally rarely delete photos because if they're garbage they're garbage. The piece about the rolled-up skin is also an important reason for pause. And the shorts too and other details ... well, you get the point. Anyway, altogether an in-depth and just analysis. Thank you for your upload.\n\nI remember hearing about the true crime Smiley Face murders where all the evidence points towards murder but police keep denying that anything sinister may be going on. I think we need to wonder, in this case too, whether police or authorities are covering things up due to corruption or fears of losing tourism revenues, mitigating the chances of a lawsuit, etc. I wish someone would interview all the tour guides, surrounding locals, and even police in great detail.",

You also provide wrong information, they did not have a plan to go with him on the trail, they had a plan to go with him to a completely different tour. You also left out a lot of information that is most relevant for the case, that is that none of the photos were deliberately shared by Panama police, but rather leaked by someone and they are all manipulated already. Also, there are a lot more photos and videos not released, aside from a lot of evidence simply never processed, and leads never followed. Why did girls not take a single photo between day 1 and 8? If they thought their camera was malfunctioning until 1 in the morning then they realized it started working, why not shoot a video message then? or take any actual relevant photos of their location. The river did so much damage to their bodies that in 2 months there's bleaching on one of the bones found but the camera did not fall apart and the glasses did not break. And coincidentally, heads or torsos were never found. Anyway, no the case is not solved, and to think they got lost is wishful thinking.",

Also, the night pictures could clearly be staged, and why did they not make more photos with their camera during those 5 days? .  Panama would have a lot to gain from it not being foul play. Also those volunteers being called away after 4 days so they can get their own people in seems pretty suspect to me. Since they had no idea where to look, the more people the better right? Especially the guides that know that place better than anyone.  Not to mention the amount of crime that is known to happen in that area.  Moreover no matter how you spin it, its really strange that only 5% of one and 10% of the others bones were recovered. Almost like they were planted. Also those guys who might have known more mysteriously dying soon after.   All things that not have been raised during this incredibly one sided video.",

A pelvis was found it showed no signs of trauma either, how were they then dismembered if not by natural wildlife. I believe Lisanne must have been in distress after sustaining a fractured ankle  and the photo with their personal belongings on the rock shows her to be in distress, she must have been to some degree. Her fractured ankle would explain the calls for help but it was not a fatal injury, as you stated it is a well travelled trail. The deleted photo might not have deleted by them as it could have been a group photo along with the 2 Dutch men they met previously, as known of the photo's taken were off excellent quality why just delete this one only?\nIt's a mystery alright, but thank you for correlating the data for us.",

That means someone sat in one spot taking photos of the dark night sky and treetops for hours in the middle of the night.",

        "text": "The theory I heard there in Panama is that Kriss and Lisanne were ABDUCTED that same afternoon, either on the El Pianista trail or upon returning from the trail— a witness said the girls were getting into a red pickup truck on the road at the end of the day—and that the girls DIDN'T MAKE the emergency calls because their attackers took their cell phones. \r\nThe idea is that their attackers dialed the emergency numbers TO CREATE a story of disorientation in the jungle, to make people believe the girls were lost in the jungle or had an accident. That's the most credible theory; that's why there are no photos of them lost or injured, nor any messages from them to their parents or boyfriends. \r\nAnd regarding the LAST PHOTOS taken with the camera eight days later, the explanation is SIMILAR.\r\nThe Dutch investigator said on television that those pictures must have been taken by the criminals, their captors, trying to light the way with the flash in the wee hours. One of those photos was a photo of Kriss's hair, apparently from the back of her head. By that time, the girls were gone; they had been murdered",

        "text": "I have been following the case since the begining.\r\n\r\nI have over 30 years of experience - 3 of them at night - working in tropical forests like the one where the girls disappeared. The theory that best fits all the available data - in my opinion - is that the girls got lost after something strange happened on the trail.\r\n\r\nIt could have been someone or something that scared them, or they simply decided to relieve themselves off the trail and were unable to return. I have worked with many people in the forest and this is a common practice.\r\n\r\nIf foul play occurred, it was before they left the trail or after with the backpack. I do not believe in cannibals, organ trafficking and photos altered by bandits.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that they were kidnapped for several days either. The data from their phones and especially from the night photos do not suggest this. However, what happened to the backpack is what makes me not 100% sure that they simply got lost.\r\n\r\nThat said, I must point out that tropical forests are extremely dangerous, even for experienced hikers.\r\n\r\nIf you doubt try by yourself. I do not agree with several statements that the girls were literally walking in the backyards of houses on a trail where it is impossible to get lost.\r\n\r\nIt is always possible to get lost.\r\n\r\nThe forest they were in seems very dense and vast to me from the videos of Romain C that I watched. I have gotten lost countless times on easier trails than this one in Panama. Trails that I know well.\r\n\r\nThis happens mainly on the way back. Because the light conditions change - fog - and there are small paths - forks - that are only visible on the way back... Now imagine two girls who did this long trail for the first time, without GPS, without knowing the place and without much water or clothes.\r\n\r\nIt would be almost impossible for them not to get disoriented at some point. And the photos before the Mirador suggest that they had doubts about the path even on the way up. On these trails there are people and animals that can create false paths anywhere at any time.\r\n\r\nTrees can fall, causing you to leave the trail to go around. Anyway.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is the holes in the forest floor. In Brazil, there is a famous case of Kamal Guster who disappeared COMPLETLY AND FOREVER when he was only 80 meters away from his friend in the forest. I have fallen into a hole in the forest once. If you hit your head and the hole is small but deep you may never be found. Rivers are also very dangerous. Anyway.\r\n\r\nNature is a formidable killer. When you are at the top of the mountain, the simple decision to take the wrong path down in a moment of distraction or due to dehydration can be fatal. It is curious how few people here have realized that the path beyond Mirador is a mirror in terms of reference points in relation to the path up.\r\n\r\nThe reference points are repeated, giving the impression that you may be descending on the correct side of the mountain. But you are not. Anyway, I have been through countless things and met many strange people on trails too, so it may also be possible that they initially suffered foul play and then got lost.

So the idea that someone was trying to access the phone to call is off putting. If the phone was an apple device, the phone would've been locked out and even so the memory is encrypted to access. The only way I see this, is that someone was trying to access the phone for information (maybe the missing photo) and if they managed to remove this, this had to of been an SD card with pictures defaulted to save there or it was an un-encrypted OS running on the phone (possibly android). In which case you should be able to access the phone and track down logs of what devices accessed what on the phone....Hopefully stored meta-data would help",

        "text": "In the disappearance of these two Dutch girls, there are two situations that I don't understand and I believe that need a more careful analysis:\n1-If in the first two calls to the Dutch emergency number, they were already under the control of kidnappers, why didn't the criminals take the phones, the camera and all their belongings?\n\nThis doesn't make any sense! No offenders with murderous or sexual intentions would risk being photographed by their victims, or even risk the girls calling the police or leaving a message recorded on their cell phones for when they are found by the authorities.\n\n2- Why don't you have any attempt to call 911 during the night?\n\nWhat would be the worst moment for two girls from an urban environment, lost in the middle of a tropical jungle?\nDo you agree with me that this worst moment would be to spend the night in the forest?! Exhausted, cold, with animals moving on the ground, animal movement in the dark forest, a plague of insects, rain spray, hunger, thirst and darkness everywhere. This would undoubtedly be the time when they would most try to connect to an emergency number, but they didn't.\n\nTrying to explain these two situations, the best way to harmonize was as follows:\nLisanne and Kris decided on their own, to continue the trail past the viewpoint, when they realized they couldn't make it back before nightfall, or because they really got lost and disoriented, they decided to make the first two calls in the late afternoon of April 1st. . Without success, they must surely have screamed for help. They were certainly answered and rescued by someone who heard them both scream, or someone who somehow passed them on the trail. This would explain why the girls did not attempt to call an emergency number during the night, that is, they felt safe to be accompanied by someone they believed to be trustworthy and well intentioned.\nAfter that, they certainly went with that someone, to some nearby property, where they continued to be deceived by lies that reassured them, but that at dawn and after a night's sleep, they always tried to make another emergency call, until the cell phone battery has discharged.\nIt was at that moment that this someone realized that they were totally incommunicado and certainly decided to attack and take their belongings that were all inside the backpack.\nFrom then on, all the evil that befell the girls began.\n\nIn my opinion, between the moment the last cell phone ran out of charge and the dawn of the 8th, Kris Kremers was killed, so in the photos taken on the 8th, only the hair of a lifeless body of Kris appears, trying to simulate a disappearance, with them lost in the night trying to signal their position in the woods and kris dead in Lisanne's arms (who doesn't appear in the photos) as it's the killer planting false evidence, not Lisanne!\n\nAs the pieces of Lisanne Froon's skin were found in mid-June, in an initial state of decomposition, this shows that Lisanne was killed in early June and was under the control of this someone who killed her, for about 60 days. She was the last to die.\n\nNote 1: Seeing the holes in Kris' Jeans, it shows that her dead body was dragged a short distance, where it was thrown. That is, this may indicate that the place where Kris and Lisanne were killed and the bodies were subjected to a chemical treatment for dismemberment and then concealment, are very close to each other, and may be in the vicinity of this property where they felt \"safe\" .\n\nNote 2: Kris' boot found, was it clean and without any remains inside? No animal in the forest, would be interested in carrying a leather boot in her mouth! It's not food! That's how the animals would see this boot, any object, they would have smelled it and gone. That boot was taken to the forest by the killer.\n\nNote 3: The police know of more evidence, maybe even the photo that was deleted. At the very least, they want to make some strategic use.\n\nConclusion: Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon, were held captive in an environment they thought was safe, were killed, stripped naked, with the bodies being dismembered by some chemical process as yet unknown. Some dismembered parts, along with the girls' boots, clothes and backpack with all the girls' belongings, were deliberately abandoned along the straight-line trail to create false leads and simulate that the girls died of hunger and thirst after getting lost in the deep in the forest.\n\nThe death of these innocent girls touched me a lot! This is my small contribution to unravel their deaths and thus lead to a punishment, the possible murderer and the possible collaborators.\n\nFortaleza-CE, Brazil.\n\nI very much hope that Jesus Christ will comfort Kris and Lisanne's parents.",

        "text": "I read/watched a lot about this tragedy. I guess the girls confused which trail come back. I do not believe in murder because girls kept camera /phone all the way. Be lost in such jungles is possible because both trails are downhill. Which one is the correct after a long day? I guess that Kris was wounded after the first [but before the second] river cross. This could explain why the girls spent so many time in trail. When you are tired, without food and water and in the dark it is easy to slip and hurt the head in some stone. I guess that Lisanne helped Kris and both stayed together almost all the time. This made progress slow and Lisanne gone tired in few days. I also think that at some point the girls thought that it would be easier to keep following downhill than come back wounded to the top of the mountain. I think Lisanne was so tired and left Kris [perhaps very weak] in the second river branch near the rock that appeared in late photographs. I think that when Kris situation aggravated Lisanne took decision to seek desperately for help, living Kris at a place easy to rescuers see. Lisanne marked the place with the red marks seen upon a stone in some of the night pictures… I think that some night pictures were took trying to reach the cables to cross the second branch of Serpent River. Contrary to people think the night picture showing riverbank and plants was took from bellow to upward. It do not represent a precipice. So all legs and people lying in the ground [wounded Kris actually] are impossible theories looking at that picture. Plants grow up searching for light. Plants do not look natural if one consider that the night picture with plants show a precipice.  Lisanne tried to overcome in despair the second branch of Serpent River but probably fell hurting badly the ankles. That was the end. Both girls [probably hurt] died of hypothermia because many local people say that Boquete have cold rains. Another possibilities are: 1. Lisanne drowning by exhaustion/loss of consciousness [after 11 days] when she fell trying to cross the river, breaking his ankle; 2. death by flash foods since at least one or two heavy rains occurred in the period the girls were lost. The route downhill is filled of canals made by flash foods. I guess that some heavy rain carried the bodies/bag/shorts to the river and fishes did the rest. Some another heavy rain [small predators] could depositing remains away from margins. RIP Kris and Lisanne.",

        "text": "1. They didn't take the dog. Why the host family would give them their dog? He doesn't even know them, he doesn't obey them.The hosts just wanted to prove that they cared about the girls and did everything for them. That's why they lied that. It's impossible that if you have a dog and you take several photos, the dog doesn't seem on any pictures. But, had he been there or not, he wouldn't have been affected on the case.\n\n2. The night shots were taken in heavy raining. And two hours after that, a shot was taken about Kris's hair, which seems like it's completely dry with some clotted blood on it. Okay, maybe the rain stopped and her hair already dried up. But, this hair doesn't seem like a dried up hair, just right now. Unless she combed it! But, at night, in the dark jungle?\nThis means for me, she died not at that night, or even not in the forest! We can't see properly, where was taken this picture. Maybe in a house? It's a very good quality picture, not like any picture, that they has taken before.\nI think it was made in calm, stable, and dry conditions, not unlike someone try to escape from a dark jungle at night.\n\n3. One of the happy pictures which is about Lisanne at the Mirador has been photoshopped! And the authorities found it this way on the camera's memory card? How?\n\n4. After the two photos at the creek, and a photo which is irretrievably missed, they didn't take a shot for a whole week! Why?\n\n5. It's ok, Lisanne's foot was in her boot. This can be happen if someone died and during decomposition, the limbs become detached. But, Kris's boot was empty! How? Seriousley, is she died without wearing her boot ? And what about the interesting fact, that both boots that were found, it is the left one? Such a coincidence? I say, it's weird.\n\n6. Kris's short was found on a rock, folded and zipped, no blood, in a dry, neat condition. How would happened this, if she had an accident, how is that possible? Again, is she died without wearing her shorts , or did anyone take off her shorts after she died? Why? And who was that?\n\n7. Lisanne's backpack was found on a rock, in a dry and neat condition like their stuff, which was inside. The phones and the camera was in working order. How would happened this, if they had an accident somewhere and died? How did the backpack get out from there, no water, no damage? The backpack has no legs and cannot fly...\n\nCompared to what the Panamanian authorities say, they were lost and had an accident, and died because of that, there are many mysterious and incredible circumstances here. You don't have to be a theoretical physicist to find out this was a foul play and unfortunately the girls died probably a violent death. Rest in peace!   ♱👩🏻👩🏼♱",

Why the hell would they all of a sudden become super adventurous and continue onto the serpent trail and take a total of 3 photos before the nightmare photos on April 8th? You people say she must've grew some balls and kept going, this was a girl who took tons of pictures and journaled a lot but decides to not take anymore pictures? All of the photos show them on the direct serpent trail after the mirador, so let's rule out \"ThE LaSt PhOtOs WeRe ThE DeEp JuNgLE!\" because that is totally false. I don't know what happened to these girls but stop knocking others' speculation when your theory could sound just as stupid to foul play theorists.

Pour info Pas Besoin d'être calé en informatique pour faire disparaitre une photo , c'est juste un copier coller entre 2 cartes sd , si on a pas trouvé les infos et les résidus de la photo 509 sur la SD c'est que ce n'est pas la SD d'origine tout simplement, il s'agit d'une autre carte SD, lors de la copie des photos seules les photos et leurs exif ont été copiés   , ce que je veux dire c'est qu'il s'agit pas d'un clonage de SD mais juste une copie des fichiers existant sur une autre carte et par là les résidus ne sont pas copiés donc absents ! Et tu sais bien toi même que entant que explorateur que rarement tu te ballade dans ton sac juste avec une seule carte SD t'en a toujours d'autres avec toi en cas de besoin lors des aventures surtout pour 1 mois. Il sont peut être même aller en chercher une autre directement dans leur chambre avec l'aide du guide tout simplement , et si ont pris une neuve  alors il y aura rien dessus à part ce qui y est copié vulgairement ! Pour moi mon analyse c'est que c'est pas la carte d'origine c'est simple. Autre choses je pense même que ceux qui ont fait ça sont plus là non plus et sont dans la même rivière , car cela à du bien déranger les cartels locaux , une visibilité internationale sur leur petit businesss, ça a pas du passé , et il faut pas sous estimé les cartels car la loi c'est eux et il règlent les soucis assez vite , ce qui me fait penser que les assassins sont plus de ce monde non plus !",

Four men knew if one includes the guide who went into their room and went through their things. Did he know they weren't coming back?\nLocals have said they heard girls screaming, a huge crash, and then three men exiting (running out of) the trail.\nThe crash was more than likely Kris and Lisanne being pushed over into the ravine (the screams were an indicator that they were either being chased or attacked?) The predators had to kill them because the girls knew them? \nThe photographs are seemingly taken at the bottom of the ravine *looking upwards to where the body/bodies had fallen from). It is possible that the person who found the backpack and the body/bodies (some parts at least, considering Kris' hair) was taking photos (checking to see if it worked perhaps?) and was taking photos upwards to where the body had fallen from. Kris' hair was quite clean which is odd; was she in water or in some protected area? It's chilling to think that perhaps the attackers/killers eventually made their way down to the bodies...Perhaps what was left of the bodies was found soon after the plunge to their deaths but left there, unreported, and only the backpack was taken.\nThe deleted photo? Perhaps the backpack was handed to someone else (a guide, or someone else in authority) and that person encouraged them to hand it over to authorities, or perhaps the people who found the body took the backpack home with them and at some point got scared (superstitions could also add to the fear) and then handed it in at a later date. Perhaps they were too afraid to admit to finding Kris (and perhaps Lisanne) because they had taken the backpack? Kris had beautiful hair - hair that would be noticeable anywhere! Two lovely girls who were probably taught that a stranger is just a friend you do not know!",

If it was just a consequence of an error by the camera, well that's definitely the ugliest joke by fate ever.\ni also don’t believe it was necessary for them to switch the SD-cards. it just doesn’t make any sense, all these theories about that they probably didn’t want to save the picture and etc. sound like pure bullshit. Everything was ok till photo 509. i don’t believe they’ve just stopped making photos after they crossed the stream at pic 508. \n\n2) photos taken in the night after a few DAYS in the jungle. these pics are weird af and i can never believe they could not record themselves if they were alive at that time. just a few pics with their faces, legs, bodies would be enough to make it clear. \n\ni used to believe that after 4 pm on April 1st the girls headed off the trail and got in trouble but it wasn't a catastrophe, and they were alive until April 4th. \nALSO i believe the camera was stolen/lost and those night pics were not made by them.\nthen after April 4th something really bad happened and MAYBE they've met with foul play.\nMaybe they were not murdered but somebody was involved. Maybe it’s just a huge cover up case for someone not to be mentioned, ever.",

As this had to have happened after the 70 pix were taken for the camera to keep proper count and display a missing photo in the count. Then, after reaching a computer and some form of civilization, Lisanne doesn't inform anyone, or contact help for even herself. She then heads back into the Jungle, right to where Kris's body was so she her self could die in the jungle with her friend. Explaining why Kris's bones were in a diff condition than her own more recent corpse.                  See, when you lay it all out. For it to have been an accidental death of both girls and all the info to fit, creates a ridiculous scenario. There is literally no way the evidence fits with out it being foul play of a 3rd party or multiple 3rd parties. The girls were murdered",

Il faut savoir aussi que c’est loin d’être la seule disparition mystérieuse dans la région mais de loin la plus médiatisée et documentée. Ça renforce cette hypothèse.",

Cette histoire est vraiment une torture du cerveau.\nEt si les filles auraient rencontré deux hommes qui se serait fait passer pour guides ou autre et les auraient emmené dans un petit sentier. Cela expliquerait que personne les a croisé, et qu’elles n’ont pas suivi les chemins. Les hommes auraient commencé à abuser d’elles ou être violent et les auraient emmené vers un ravin ou leur seule échappatoire aurait été de sauter. D’où l’appel à l’aide et les deux hommes qu’aurait aperçu et entendu un randonneur. \nLa chute aurait entraîné la mort quasi instantanée de Kris qui expliquerait l’observation des spécialistes sur les os de Kris où elle aurait subi une chute. Lisiane aurait ensuite essayé d’appeler les secours. \nPour les 100 photos cela me fait penser aux photos de l’affaire du col de Dyatlov… je me demande si les deux filles ne seraient pas déjà toutes les deux décédées à ce moment là. \nLa photo 509 pourrait être un selfie avec les deux hommes qu’elles pensaient être des « amis » et qui aurait été supprimée pour ne pas dévoiler leur identité. \n\nPour les théories que tu as évoqué, je ne vois pas comment en 6jours toute seule, Lisiane n’aurait pas écrit son histoire. Elle qui raconte tout sur son carnet… ou alors peut-être des pages arrachées fait en même temps que les 100 photos étranges…",

        "text": "I have never been to the location myself. But from people who walked the same trail I heard you have to do your best pretty hard to get lost. That it is more rural than jungle. Of course when you go off the trail it quickly becomes dense jungle-like vegetation. I can understand you can quickly lose your sense of direction. On the other hand they had compass…  They kept traveling north away from the trail… \n\nIf I compare it to other stories where people went lost while hiking, you often see that when people realise they are lost… they start to document messages and explanations of what happened for the people that might find them (alive or dead). Absence of this is of course no evidence for foul play. But also,  their deaths are almost no comparison with the regular hiking-gone-wrong stories. It can contain some unique element of course which is a good explanation for this, but I think we should NOT look for that explanation in nature or the jungle. \n\nMy working theory so far is that they tried to escape from someone who tried to do them harm or scared them with it’s behaviour, and therefore went north much further than they ever intended. After which they got seriously got lost. In a moment of presumed safety they started to make those pictures by daylight in which you see Kris by herself, instead of the two of them together. This to record where they have been while trying to get back. This also explains why they have been able to still use their phones and camera, unlike when they would have been kidnapped right away. Eventually the person they tried to get away from was simply waiting for them somewhere on a return path or caught up with them. This is when they eventually still met their fate… \n\nI’m convinced there is an unknown third party involved here, even though there is no direct evidence for it. So far it is the only theory I can think of that fits why they kept going north, were still able to use the phones, camera and so on and why they met similar fates. I would expect in a death by nature that eventually one of them died one way and the other at another moment in another way. If they died by nature I would not expect their stuff to also end up in different places, neither would I expect clothes to get separated from the body. \n\nI can only speculate who this was or what has happened then. And what has killed them.  But I do think the person(s) in point got nervous when all the police and investigators started to come in. This is why the criminal(s) has/ have succesfully (killed them, if they didn’t already and) chopped up and undressed the bodies (this explains how clothing and body got separated). Making it easier cooking meat from the bones or using something else to achieve a similar effect. This to eventually mask the cause of death and anything that might point to the one(s) guilty. Eventually this will also make it easy to scatter any evidence , hiding it in nature. To finally make sure enough is found for authorities to draw a conclusion from (the wrong one perferably) and stop any further investigation search. And permanently hide anything that has clear evidence of the crime. It explains why the backpack and everything in it was in top condition while the bodies were far from it. \n\nIf it was organized crime I would have expected them to have enough power to make the investigation stop without scattering any evidence. This leads me to think it is some local criminal (group). Perhaps they removed the photo from the camera with a laptop (it is probably deleted after the last photo was taken, otherwise the number of the file might have been taken by the new photo) because it did contain evidence. Perhaps the local investigators did this after taking in the evidence, we can speculate on why. Perhaps because they want to hide the evidence to not damage the local tourism, perhaps they were pressured into it, perhaps the criminal works for law enforcement, perhaps it was an honest mistake and it means nothing.\n\nI think that photo was the key, but I’m also convinced that any other evidence is needed to really crack this case. And I think any new discovery will support the theory above. We will see. \n\nI wish my best to the parents and family of Kris and Lisanne. I hope one day they will find closure. I am a father of a daughter myself and I don’t want to imagine what they must be going through. Nothing anybody will say will close this open wound in their hearts.",

You never mentioned how they got the photos from the phone, or did I miss it? \nI think they just took first evening photo to light up the way, still havent realized that they lost, so they just deleted the useless photo from the album. But once they realized they are lost then they stopped bothering deleting them. Kinda simple and logical explanation. \n\nOverall seems like they wandered off the trail and got lost, eventually died near some village, got discovered by locals who feared to be blamed by officials for their death so they scattered their remains all around the forest.",

But which of the girl's foot was it that was recovered that had that fracture or broken bone(s)? Ie, the one that was taking the pictures, or the one that seemed further ahead in the later pictures?\nFurthermore, could it be determined if the break had occurred some amount of time prior to death? Because, if those questions aligned, I would suggest the possibility that, why the \"photographer\" girl seems to be lagging behind in the last photos, is DUE to having a foot injury and being unable to keep up as easily. And if you're in pain, not to mention feeling like you may be dragging/slowing your friend down, at least I'm the type of person who would most definitely take out something like a camera to try to make the situation a little more lighthearted, or take focus off the fact I'm needing to take longer. Or kinda hide my resting that foot with the seconds it takes to stand still to take a photo. etc.\n\nWhile I def can't say anything for certain, that's something that just happened to come to mind. I personally strongly get the vibe they were being pursued by something. Be it human or even potentially an animal or something, but just, how I interpreted the details anyway, it seems like it all kinda aligns with that.\nI also especially agree with, at least the possibility, I think it's more than a slight chance or a shot in the dark to assume that they were snapping photos, to use the flash, to help them navigate at night. I remember one of the first videos I watched and was introduced to this case for the first time, they actually had not mentioned or proposed that, but I naturally had thought of that as a possibility.",

The girls were held in captivity until the 'heat died down', and during those few months the girls were killed, bodies dismembered and bleached, and the camera had a photo deleted by a computer.   Then the girls belongings and body parts are all returned to the region where the girls went mission, so that they can be discovered and the case can be closed. Its not a coincidence that the bag was found so quickly. It was intended to be found, with the camera and money, so to complete the narrative that the girls became lost and died.\n\nI realize this is a couch-detective nonsense, but given the above, this is not a mystery of how, but a mystery of who (Be it Government, serial killer, or local gang).",

        "text": "A less creepy theory would be that the girls went off track, in a moment of excitement, and then realized they were lost. They quickly became disorientated and in an attempt to get back to the track, they got lost deeper into the jungle. Kris fell and got injured, or lost consciousness due to lack of food & water. Lisanne last photos at night are her trying to signal a plane or light the forest up. But eventually they were eaten by some form of big cat (Jaguar etc) The clean cut of her foot is just a coincidence, and some random person found the backpack (thinking it was just lost property) and attempted to get access to the phone by typing in the incorrect password. \n\nA creepy theory is that yes this was a murder, they were stalked in the jungle, the photos at night is Lisanne hearing noises of the killer and trying to light the forest up to see him/her. They were killed, cut up, and distributed throughout the jungle. The killer got access to the phone, took a photo of himself with the bodies, realised it was a mistake and deleted it. And then disappeared to do it again somewhere else.",

Second in this video the left side rocks are lots and bigger and the water where it is coming on the left is higher than the photo of Kris. Third, on the Kris photo there is much more space than this on the video.",

Si la photo ou la video 509 prise a la suite (peut être discrètement prise ) est effacée , c'est en effet parce qu'elle montre assurément les futurs assassins . \nMais si elles s'engagent  volontairement sur le chemin , c'est qu'elles sont un peu en confiance ... mais pas vraiment puisque lisanne prend la photo ou la video en douce . \nEn conclusion les individus ont été informé par un tiers , une connaissance des filles mais il est absent en haut du chemin . Ils réussissent a convaincre les filles de les suivre mais elles hésitent et lisanne prend son appareil . elles chercheront peut être a s'échapper et a appeler des secours  un peu après mais elles seront rattrapées et la suite ne peut être qu'un cauchemar ....photos et découvertes a la suite en faisant foi .L'instigateur ne peut être que la personne qui a poussé les jeunes femmes a faire ce périple pour qu'elle tombent dans les griffes de ses complices .",

Merci a Lionel d'avoir pu réunir ces documents qui permettent de réfléchir a cette affaire . il ne faut pas se faire trop d'illusions , cette affaire ne se résoudra pas autrement que par la volonté des autorités locales ....Il y a pas mal d'éléments pour la résoudre , semble t'il . D'abord ces jeunes femmes n'étaient pas si naives  et elles ont assurément fait confiance aux conseils d'un guide sauf que ce guide ne les accompagne pas . Ma question est pourquoi n'annulent elles pas leur randonnée dans ce cas ? Elles partent pourtant  rassurées et en confiance , mais bien seules ... Qu'est ce qui a pu les convaincre de partir ? La responsabilité du guide est fortement engagée et celui ci  a du avoir de bons arguments  pour les encourager .Cà , c'est une quasi certitude .Ensuite a la fin de la randonnée , elles s'engagent dans la jungle au lieu de rentrer donc elles ne sont plus seules : On les attendait certainement et encore une fois , elles sont convaincus de suivre des personnes qu'elles ne semblent pas connaitre puisque essaieront de les prendre en photo , l'appareil photo leur est retiré certainement après cela ,cela prouve bien que l'enlèvement est prémédité, il n'y a rien d'opportuniste dans cette rencontre, a mon avis  . A partir de la fameuse photo effacée ,elle ne seront plus maitresses de leurs mouvements ; Elles sont contraintes de suivre mais elles ont toujours leurs tel . Je note qu'elles ne prennent pas de photos avec leur tel mais envoient de nombreux appels de détresse et cela de nombreuses fois entre le 1er avril entre 16h39 elle 3 avril a 9h32 . c'est très long et cela cela correspond probablement à un très long périple d'au moins 12H avant que leurs tel et leurs sac leurs soient enlevé , probablement à l'arrivée . Le fait qu'il n'y  a pas de réseau , c'est qu'elles restent à l'écart de tout centre urbain . Un journée de marche dans la jungle dans des zones escarpées les amènent tout au plus a une trentaine de km de leur point de départ ( 15/20 km a vol  d'oiseau max ) ou elles seront séquestrés un bon bout de temps avant être assassiné . Enfin la découverte du sac et des ossements est peut être un geste envers les familles ce qui me fait penser que l'un des assassins aurait peut être été lui même en contact avec les familles et par intérêt ou je ne sais quoi , aurait laissé de maigres indices pour montrer que Lisanne et Kris étaient mortes .\nAu passage ils ont du laisser ces indices loin du lieu de détention pour égarer encore l'enquête .Y aura t'il  résolution de l'affaire un jour , c'est peu probable mais qui sait ... souhaitons le .",

        "text": "For any interested:  The Photo 509 issue was convincingly solved by Rotten Raven Studios.  Their camera's firmware can skip a number in the filename sequence when the user is near a time zone border due to GPS exif data setting the clock back or forward.  Kris and Lisanne were within a few miles of a timezone border.  Photo 509 probably wasn't deleted because it was likely never taken in the first place.\r\n\r\nRegarding the condition of the bodies:  It's a well known phenomenon that bodies skeletonize and disperse in just a few weeks when they're in the jungle due to heavy rainfall, insects, and large animals scavenging the remains.  Kris's bones were bleached white likely due to her dying first (as evidenced by the unsuccessful PIN attempts on her phone) so the elements had more time to act on them.  And also possibly by the location in which she died receiving more direct sunlight and/or faster insect-driven defleshing.\n\nThe backpack and contents being in pristine condition is the one piece of evidence that doesn't make sense.  But it's also possible that it was found by locals before they were aware of the disappearance, and later returned to the jungle by them anonymously in order to avoid suspicion of involvement by investigators.",

He has done immense research into this case, and there is evidence of Photoshop on the photos at the top of the hill. Poor manipulation of these pictures is very evident. Evidence of photo manipulation is in the file encoding process as well. The missing picture was deleted by someone else on a computer obviously after the fact. It seems to have all been done to mislead investigators. This was NOT an accident.",

So possibly they could have got off trail heading down the private property side.  Also they showed the boot, which had the partial leg and foot, which had the proper decomposing for the time frame.  That was determined to be from one girl and her hip bone was found which also was property decomposed.  A hip bone from the other girl was bleached white, which Cartels have been known to do to cover and dissolve bodies, using lye or something similar.  What if one of them stepped into a pit trap and got her leg stuck and was found by some bad people.  They could have taken the other girl and raped her and killed her and  buried her.  Then to cover up later they place the backpack, in a place where it doesn't point to them.  There could have been other photos showing the area, which the perps overwrote with black photos.  Possibly those coffee farms may be used for something else and the locals know it know not to be caught pointing the finger at them, so a limited investigation",

Either they walked back and completed the hike, and shortly after ”ran into” the guys and followed them to party, which quickly turned ugly, in accordance to the testimony that Juan supposedly gave to Margarita. I think this is the most plausible for many reasons. Also don’t see why he would make that up. \n\nOr the guys stalked them in the jungle (or pretended to run into them and having them willingly go with), and went to a location on the other side of the mountain (don’t remember who but someone, maybe feliciano? has one or more properties there) and were killed there.\n\nAgain, I think that the girls kept taking photos that day.. Who knows how many was at one point on that memory card.\n\nWhat ultimately sealed the foul play theory for me (on top of the many indications and evidence pointing towards it), was seeing some of Henry Gonzales facebook posts. In 2012 he posted two photos where he is posing with a young girl, dead. I’ve never seen something so disturbing before and will probably never get it out of my head. In the photo, the girl’s head is partly burnt and covered in coal and ashes. He is sitting in a chair beside her, bending down towards her doing the victory sign, looking like he’s having a good time. I am appalled how that can be on facebook. \nHave you seen it or made a video or comment somewhere about it @scarlet R?",

Those make more sense in the “one he gets hurt but is conscious to unlock the phone until she’s not” or the outright “getting lost” theories. My suspicion is that it might have been a case of running blindly away from something and getting lost. Someone said that it was difficult to get lost on the path, so that’s why I suspect that. The deletion of the photo might be unrelated. If we’d have a time stamp, then it would be much clearer what happened, but they might have deleted the photo before they got lost. Maybe the camera misfired, maybe a photo was very unflattering, there can be many reasons. I’d kill to get a look at the photo though, seriously. It might answer so many questions.",

Because of how the JPEG algorithm works (DCT --> compression), it's decently resilient to corruption. DCT transform offers some redundancy in case certain harmonics in the cosine sequence are lost, and compression makes it less likely that critical data was overwritten due to smaller size.\n\nTwo things make the deletion of image 509 particularly spooky to me:\n1) I personally could probably recover IMG_509.\n2) Notice that IMG_509 was taken between the last remarkably 'happy' photo taken by the girls, and photos of the wilderness at night...

Maybe, when she didn't move, she hid from her attacker, trying to make a picture of the scenario. When she was found, the attacker tried to enter her phone in order to delete possible evidence of him/her. They then took their backpack, deleted the photos and brought it to some other place where it was going to be found to be able to declare it as an accident. A woman, who went hiking in Panama with the guy who wanted to lead the girls on the trail, stated that he talked about cutting her legs with a machete. One of the girl's feet was found severed. I hope that one day this will be solved.",

        "text": "Previously I thought that the girls just get lost in the jungle in some reason and became a victims of lack of the compass in their equipment. It could be straight explaintation why Kris and Lisanne didn't found the way back and keep going deeper, and deeper, and deeeeper into the jungle. When you got the compass, you just need to go possibly straight and watch the needle to be sure that it's still in the same position relative to the direction of your walk. The girls didn't have the compass that they never knew if they walking in the constant direction or walking around and passing the same places.\n\nThen I watched the video made by Kris' parents. They arrived in Panama some time after Kris and Lissane vanished to walk through the El Pianista trail and try to find any answers what could happen to their daughter. That video made me confused: there's just ONE PATH ON THIS TRAIL! Just one, no more! There are also a lot of rocks too that doesn't allow you to go out of the trail. There was NO CHANCES that the girls could get lost.\n\nAnd finally I found your video, especially second part of it. Great job, man! Of course there's still no any indisputable PROOFS - just circumstantial evidence - but at now i know that Kris and Lisanne for sure DIDIN'T GET LOST in the jungle.\n\nI wonder about the time between 3rd and 10th April. There was no further 112 or 911 calls - just only switch on the phones and signal check instead. I think those fellas could take the girls into the jungle to prevent to be discovered by the police searching for Kris and Lisanne. They for sure already knew that probably everybody from the Boquete knows that the girls are missing. In the jungle there was no signal anymore that  Kris and Lisanne was only checking signal (without entering the PIN and making a call attempt). They was held somwhere in the middle of the jungle propably from 3rd April afternoon and get killed at 6th April (the last signal check on this day) or at night between 6th and 7th April. Then at 11th April one of those fellas switched on an Iphone (without entering the PIN, of course) that belonged to departed Kris and switched it off an hour later. Then he collect all the dead girls' belongings and calmly put it into their backpack. The rest got rid of the bodies and traces.\n\nWhat about the 90 photos from the night, especially of the back of Kris' head? I think it could be simply to explain it: Kris probably was dead on this photo (we can't see anything more than her hair). Why the fellas made the photos? Have no idea. Maybe they were \"proud\" of their crime and decided to play a bit with departed Kris' and Lisannes camera?",

Interesting story definitely, I also think accident.",

It was Kris, and there was another photo of Kris' head showing a large head wound.  The sticks were arranged to point towards her body and another marker was pointed towards the direction  Lisanne went in when she realised she had to leave her dead friend behind.  This was at the point of the monkey cable bridge also seen in the enhanced photos.  Lisanne also sustained a fractured foot at some point and also succumbed to the elements in her weakened state.  All the other conspiracy theories and leads fell apart on proper inspection and the forensics are consistent with this theory.  If the Panamanian authorities left that evening or first next morning, they would have found at least Lisanne still alive.  Shocking but all too familiar Incompetence.",

A rational person in that situation will make a dozen calls atleast.Even on 2nd April they just called 4times and then once on 3rd April after losing signal.I believe that due to the presence of a third person/killer, less  call attempts were made.Further their bodies were not found which increase the chances of murder.Even there bag had fingerprints of 30 different persons including them(but these fingerprints might be old possibly of their friends or family members who may have touched their bags in the past)My claims involving chance of a hiking accident goes like this.It's pretty clear that froon was alive till 11th april as she last checked kris' iphone on that date.She probably died because of starvation or dehydration.As far as Kris' is concerned I am a bit confused as the photo of her injured head was taken on 8th April and the unsuccessful pin  attempts were made  from 6th April.How's this possible???If kris' was alive on 8th April then she should have entered the correct PIN on 6th April.It means that that photo was taken after her death(Due to some hiking accident).But then why will froon click a photo of kris' injured head after her death.Why???.Further,if there was at all a serial killer involved that they would have been killed on 1st April itself because first call was made on that date.But then if it was not murder then why their bodies were not found.Just few bones and a foot was found.Why????",

You don't have to unlock a phone to call 911 usually. \n\nThe fact that the camera and phones were all found in the backpack leads me to believe someone put them there. I just don't understand the photos if there was a 3rd party. The phone calls I understand fully but did the kidnappers sleep with them outside but didn't make a fire or light source? Would they allow them to take photos for some reason? Unless they're being held outside somehow but not monitored? Like tied up? I'm not sure",

One has the backpack, going up, the other one going down, not switching back and forth as indicated in the photo data! This was to keep the search away from the actual scene of the crime!\nThis is a MASSIVE cover-up of an absolutely heinous crime!\nThis all happened in Panama, a totally corrupt, third world country! Things don't operate as they do in Western or European countries!\nEvidence was deleted as to save a valuable tourist industry! If the details of this awful and sadistic crime were made public, NO ONE WOULD VACATION IN PANAMA!\nOn the other hand, justice may have been served! A public trial of the perpetrators would destroy the tourist industry! But, it is strange on just how many \"suspects\" were killed in a relatively short time? The government had these creeps quietly \"taken care of\". End of story, as far as Panama is concerned. I'm sure that the parents of Kris and Lisanne were aware of this! That's why we haven't heard much more from them? \nMy take on this DON'T TRAVEL TO PANAMA!",

If you pay attention to the shadows they produce, it is easy to know that the sun was well up, there was almost no shadow. This leads us to say that it was closer to noon, and looking at where the shadow is, I would say that before noon between 10:30 am and 11:00 am, and if we see the last photo before the night ones, the shadow lengthened. Very little, that leads us to think that if the girls were at the viewpoint around 1:00 p.m., the last photo was taken an hour later, which is how long it takes to reach that watercourse, meaning that they would be between 2 to 3 p.m.",

        "text": "Kyle, I am totally new to this case, but the hair photo looks like she had been possibly scalped, as it doesn't look like it was attached to a head. Why on earth did the women not turn around at the top of their hike?. I feel someone followed them and pushed them forward to their untimely demise. I also feel the person that handed in the backpack knew far more than was said, I mean come on why was the backpack in such good condition, compared to their bodies?. Also the cameras last photos weren't taken by the Women, as they always took photos of each other. I believe someone took them up and out of their hike trail and unloved them butely, because the Police, Family and other searchers were actually hot on their trail looking for them. This is a extremely Horrific story and on hearing about the taxi driver drowning seems very strange, as most people in that region know how to swim. It's a complicated case and it's a warning for young women who are traveling in that area to be aware of their surroundings and take only known hiking trails. My sincere Condolences to the Families and close friends involved.  😢❤❤",

        "text": "My guess is the weird night time photos with flash are they heard an animal out there and were either trying to see what/where it was or scare it off, especially since it stretches out over a few hours. I wouldn’t be able to sleep if I heard something in the dark and would periodically check if there was something close by. There are nocturnal big cats out there and that’d be my number one fear at night.\n\nThe “orbs” of light  are most likely the flash reflecting off something in the air, (probably rain, it is a rain forest after all) or other natural debris in the air that would be more noticeable in a photo when the background is essentially black. My guess would be it’s light rain though. I don’t think the night photos are weird at all for the circumstances.",

Several witnesses told police they saw them around 4:30. Several reported seeing the now famous red pickup truck too.   The first emergency call was around 4:40?  So, something spooked them once they got in the truck.\n\nIt's also important to remember that the guide they had booked for Apirl 2 (Feliciano), gave an interview to Channel 21 in Panama during the search, stating he thought it was foul play because the guides would have found them had it been an accident.\n\nThe Lost in Panama doc is mostly good, and informative. But there a couple of mistakes (one includes the photo of Kris). But I think they need to update it with some new interviews.",

And it wouldn't have made sense for them to venture that deep until it got dark, they would have gone back the way they came. Something happened to them soon after the first set of photos, either they were attacked then and there, or they made it back to the village and got intercepted there. I don't know if kidnappers would go though the trouble of taking all the photos in the dark though? Possibly? Or were the girls able to escape from their attackers into the jungle? It's possible the bras being folded neatly in the backpack could show that they were sleeping at night without bras when they were suddenly attacked and had to flee in a hurry leaving the backpack behind. Maybe a combination of getting attacked/kidnapped and then escaping and getting lost.",

        "text": "The pictures of Kris being further away are pretty normal to me. I can relate to the framing of the photo as my friend being further up the track and me standing back and taking in the surroundings, capturing them wandering around the environment. I feel like as they wandered further in the jungle, the track becomes narrow and usually somebody has to lead and another follows. They might have just been stopping to look at things, maybe one was slower than the other... I don't think it's that out of the ordinary. And Kris' expression just looks neutral and like they're exploring. MAYBE at this stage they are starting to get a bit unnerved because they've lost their way/ deviated from the track? But not yet fearful as it's still light out... Idk. Or if your stalker hypothesis is to be the case, maybe their high energy and good spirits have kind of dissipated and they're just starting to become aware of a potential pursuit... Capturing Kris may have been a way to have evidence of their whereabouts?\nAlso the bras could have just been taken off because they were uncomfortable. But also the swimming theory makes sense too. \nI think that review is incredibly troubling though. The threat he made is so unsettling, especially considering the state the remains were found in. And his involvement in this case..... Yeah I'm actually very suspicious. \nPutting in all that time to help the search is actually just a really easy way to serve his innocence if he was involved. He knows the area as well. It wouldn't strike me as something that was THAT far out of his capacity. If he's worked there so long, built a business in that environment, surely poor weather conditions are not something he hasn't dealt with before in that jungle...\nALSO i just thought about it. It would make sense if he left all the possessions. If he runs a coffee farm and has so much tourism.. he is probably fairly wealthy. To avoid foul play suspicion, leaving behind all the belongings intact would throw the scent off any third party involvement. I'm very curious as to what he did in those girls rooms for half an hour... Police should have searched him...",

        "text": "What you say about the photo numbering presumes that 509 was taken and then deleted before another photo was taken. There is no logical reason to assume this. If you take 509 and then 510, then delete 509, then take a picture, that will be 511. The camera will not make another 509 until the highest numbered photo it has is 508. Reason for this is that when the camera saves a picture it simply looks up the highest numbered pic taken and does +1 as filename and saves. It does NOT look for 'missing' numbers in some series. Go ahead and try it your self if you have a camera. This is how every camera I've used and observed this particular aspect of has worked, when they use a numbering scheme, usually the filename is longer like MSCD01022002001 where MSCD is fixed, first 01 is day, 02 month, 2002 year, 001 number. The formats etc change but the logic has been the same across many camera brands.",

They became lost and injured (possibly fell from a high point, given the fractures) and died at separate times. Animals scattered their bones. The photos at night were because they were afraid of animals and heard sounds...hoped to scare them off or at least see them. A photo was either deleted accidentally or deliberately because it was a mistake (has no one here ever deleted a photo!?). They made many phone calls trying to find a signal and be rescued (which they could NEVER have done if in the power of someone else). The only detail that perplexes me is the very clean backpack found so far away -- one possibility is that someone found it elsewhere, was afraid he/she would look involved, and left it  instead where they knew it would be found. It could have been in a protected place until then such as a cave or overhang (as was the girls' \"clean\" hair). Bra is not a mystery -- she changed it at some point, which is why she took extras to start with. This is not a murder story, It's a \"survivor\" story, only they didn't quite make it, although one carried on longer than the other, all alone poor thing.",

It is so hard to speculate what the girls might/might not have done and whether they came to harm through natural events or something else. Playing armchair detective is pretty silly but, as a hiking guide, lots of things make me wonder about their story. The first thing is what time did they REALLY start hiking the trail. Morning around 10-11 am (as seems to be the case from their photos) or early afternoon, as the taxi driver who dropped them off states. How many daylight hours would you have left and how would that inform you decision about whether to turn back or carry on? I understand the parents saying 'why didn't they take any photos from here, it's so beautiful?' but I don't really think it tells us much (taken enough pics,  too tired to get your camera out of your backpack, can't be bothered...there are some many reasons).  Something like a sprained ankle could be catastrophic enough, as it impedes one from walking and doesn't leave enough time to return via the way you came in daylight hours), why didn't they split up and the uninjured person try to seek help? I have no idea what happened to them and it's useless to speculate but what an awful way to die and how horrific for the parents, who will probably never get closure.",

The Indigenous woman who ‘found’ the backpack was one of his employees\n\nWhile I now believe the girls indeed met their fate at that swimming pool/hot spring, it doesn’t explain why Lisanne’s foot was found in her boot if she was swimming. \n\nI had not thought about the police changing the photos to fit their narrative. \n\nThe biggest question is motive: Why go through this elaborate cover up when the area is full of criminal activity. This is something that was done in a very calculated, planned manner that lends me to believe there is a larger issue at hand: Something a government or people who are higher up the chain to create this.\n\nThe school was a red flag for me from the start, and even more , another student went with Feliciano to the girl’s room and was there for 30 mins with him, and the next day, she flew back to Germany. That was a HUGE red flag and if she could be found, she could confirm if he removed things that indicated the girls did indeed return to the hostel to get swimming garments etc.\n\nI hold the Panamanian Government responsible for this because they are keeping it covered up. If that food/ those insoles of shoes were indeed found at a cave, why were they not tested for DNA? Why was the swimming hole investigation not made public?\n\nEven worse, I think they went to the Henry/Feliciano’s Coffee Farm, you’d find the girls remains and possibly many others, but the government chooses not to, lending me to think that family has ties inside the government and why this was swept under the rug.\n\nLastly, we have no idea if the girls were raped. That’s just speculation and best not to add for the sake of the families. The witness can only account for what she saw, not what she thought or was told. \nLastly, since Kris’s bones were found bleached and stripped vs Lisanne’s that were still covered in flesh, it is safe to say Kris died first. Again, until you have concrete evidence to prove that lungs were given to an organ donor, we can not make assumptions. \n\nAgain, please think of the families and the heart ache they must feel hearing these stories over and over again.",

And a peculiar blotch blocks off the lower portion of her legs.  Was the photographer the MURDERER who was implying that he had already KILLED and CHOPPED them up??\n\nBefore they went on their hike they had posted on Facebook that they had met two Dutch men, who supposedly didn't go with them. But, did they FOLLOW them?? It would be easier for TWO males instead of one to overpower TWO grown females",

The wild life animals are not a joke and two women are just walking around? The moment it gets dark is game over. I would absolutely panic, deal and attemp to call emergency like 500 times on the moment I start to feel ill or lost. I wonder what happened after 5th of April. Froon had no battery of her phone and then Kris's phone was attempted to be used WITHOUT PIN. Out of a sudden pictures from 8th of April appear having no context. Either the girl that survived (we don't know for a fact who) had a mental crysis and wanted to document what's going on, location and etc. or it's their possible murderer that shot the photographs to show 2-3 horrific pictures to the investigators. Poor villgers do crimes to get a better life. Because their parents were consernt about their children and went to Panama on 6th or something like that. I seriously do not understand that case I even consider it to be a unsolved goverment mystery to leave us wonder and make conspiracies. There is a missing photo after the blond hair picture.",

Ce qui est assez peu et 90 photos réécrites sur la carte peu faire que l’on ne peut pas récupérer la 509.\n\nDonc je ne sais pas pourquoi elles auraient effacé cette 509 juste après avoir la prise la 510 8 jours après mais c’est aussi une potentielle explication.",

It can you have to press 5 buttons in order. Another thing is that there is no differnce in the file name from a video or photo. So one explanation is that  one of them was going to record a final video and decided to delete it. I could see that as maybe she felt like she was giving up. Another thing I don't think was ever tested is what happens when you record a video on that camera and the battery dies half way through.  We know it had to been taken after everything else. The evidence overwelmingly supports they were lost. The 911 calls are poof they were trying to get help. Very unlikely they would have encountered someone. The bone bleaching would have happened with the types of insects in the panama jungle.  The backpack being in pristine condition and neatly packed is not supported by some accounts as well. I think it's also likely one of them became incapacitated or died from a fall and the other did'nt know the password on the phone. So I think at least part of the mystery is the incorrect information that is out there.",

When you take photos, the camera creates many folders. When you format it, you can not recover anything, but if you just erase, you can recover whatever if you haven't use it too much, cause there is a limit to recover files if you use the memory often. I'm photographer, that's why a say this. Noe, i've been watching videos about this since i don't know, maybe 2016 and recently i find in a video that maybe one guy who wanted to compain the girls was involved, cause he was so much interested into help in the investigation, even he went to the girls house from Miriam and scavenged into their things, that's so suspicious. Well, i remember many years before the girls have died, many guys from Boquete died in strange circumstances. Maybe there is a network about organs traffic, covered by local authorities.",

She looked the trail up on the computer in the B & B where they stayed. Third, knowing the gang members from previous partying seems unlikely. Kris and Lisanne went to Bocas del Toro before they came to Boquete. That's another area. However, it is possible they met Osman on the morning of April 1. Another thing is dog Blue. If you think the pictures on the Pianista Trail are real, you would expect at least one photo of Blue. I think the husky didn't join them on the trip. The owner of El Pianista Restaurant didn't get his facts straight.\n\nMy take on this case, on which I read a lot in the last 9 years, is almost the same as the mother of Osman told  the journalist in november last year. Kris and Lisanne went up there, but at 10.30 hrs in the morning. The taxi driver that brought them, was also found dead a year or so later.  They reached the summit at 13.00 - 13.30 hrs, walked for another hour or so and then turned around. Since they saw the place already, they didn't take pictures anymore. Until photo 509, which was deleted by computer. I think one of the gang members, or all of them, was on there. They met Kris and Lisanne propably an hour from the entrance of the trail, wanted to party, but Kris and Lisanne declined and called 911 (112 in The Netherlands). Later they were forced in a car, murdered and the killers made a setup with fake calls, fake night photo's. They probably covered the remains with lime, only to scatter them on the trail months later.",

Who said that the restaurant dog went with them and why? Clearly, he didn't. Of all the unconfirmed and weird statements this bothers me the most. The second is that they didn't document the hike after the 911 calls (except from the night ones on the 8th). If they were hurt or lost why wouldn't they take photos of what they went through? Most people try to document their last days if they are hurt or lost in the wilderness. Why wouldn't the girls do this?",

There is also a photo with the girls + the same two men having a bath at a strange place not at an open beach. Maybe the two men' s intentions were misunderstood by the girls.  The men wanted sexual intercourse, but the girsl thought they were just being nice...anyway, isn' t it interesting for anyone that, according to some sources, these two men died within a year compared to the disappearance of the girls? They say one of them died in a car accident the other one might have suffocated because he was found near a lake.....Ok. Isn' t it strange? What conclusion can you draw?These two men must have been the killers. Don' t mess with the Dutch!!! ( because they take revenge)",

Clean and simple. Also, who lets kidnap victims access to their cell phones? And what's with all the photos at night, did the kidnappers also let them take pictures?\nI believe the explanation might be simpler (as usually is). I honestly think that some accident happened to one of them and the other girl didn't leave her friend behind. With that kind of weather and without basic supplies it didn't take long for them to become disoriented, weak, maybe along the way someone from a village found the backpack somewhere and kept the items until they realized it belonged to the missing girls and then, afraid of repercussions,  they told they had just found it. That's why the backpack was impeccable. The girls just died of exposure or from the wounds of the fall. Maybe one first and the other a couple of days later in another spot.  \nI've read once, from a green beret I believe, that the kind of jungle the girls got lost is very treacherous because it doesn't look that dangerous but it's easy to fall in some chasm covered by vegetation, hurt yourself, lose your sense of time and direction and become dehydrated. Humidity goes through the roof during the day, you sweat and lose a lot of water and it's cold at night. Once they were off the beaten path (maybe to see some waterfall or something) and an accident happened, without supplies (specially water) and cellphone network, it's downhill from there. \nWhatever happened, may they RIP.",

        "text": "After thinking about this for a while, it is my opinion that the girls were not in the Jungle when they attempted those calls. It is the time delays that bother me. If you were in the Jungle you would pick a direction and check for signal every hour or something. The only reason you would leave a gap of 14 hours is if you were imprisoned and had a window of when they left you to get your phones out and try calling. I now believe that when the kidnapper slept was the period they could try calling emergency services. This would also explain why they did not try their parents as they needed help immediately. I believe that the last photo of one of the Girls was postmortem and that the random pictures at the end were snapped quickly by their killer whilst they planted the bag, to keep people off of the scent.",

        "text": "What happened here was an accident. Kris and Lisanne wandered off the beaten path and got lost. Both tried to call emergency services to no avail. On April 8th, one week after they originally set off, both girls attempted to cross a monkey bridge at night and Kris fell and most likely died. Lisanne checked the head wound using her camera flash. Realising Kris was dead, Lisanne using paper set up an SOS and a mirror to try to grab attention from above to where Kris' body was. She took many photos at night of the sky to try to catch the attention of helicopters which at this point were looking for the girls and, using common sense, by now she would know there are people looking for them as they have not returned home for several days. Lisanne used two arrows made from twigs and plastic, one pointing to Kris' body, and the other across a monkey bridge, where she would be crossing to get help.\n\nLisanne's battery ran out on her phone as records show, and at this point, she was using Kris' phone which she could not access as she did not know the PIN. As bone fragments from both girls were found close together, Lisanne most likely also fell nearby and broke her foot and checked for a signal. Unable to go on, most likely she lay there on April 6 for five days to conserve her strength and did not try to use her phone until April 11th. She turned on the phone one last time and left it on for one hour hoping that someone would be able to call her. After an hour the phone was turned off to conserve battery and then passed away. Because she had only Kris' phone and did not know the PIN, Lisanne was unable to leave any messages to loved ones. Due to being in the forest, their bodies decomposed at an accelerated rate and got washed away/eaten by animals.\n\nI cannot imagine what Lisanne was going through in her final days dying of starvation, thirst, and being totally alone.",

I’ve managed to turn too many corners and gotten lost going over the common, I can easily imagine that if they accidentally left the trail they could be completely disorientated while trying to get back, and get completely lost. I’m actually glad Julia mentioned about how they didn’t call 112 multiple times in a row, the turning their phones on and off and keep trying methodically to call seems quite calm, not how you’d act if something sudden or terrifying happened imo. The photos were them looking around in the dark, maybe they heard noises or were just trying to figure out where they were. The hair photo is them checking her head for either injuries or bugs. The photos towards the sky could be either signalling or just trying to light up the area. Their bodies were scattered by animals. It’s really sad because they tried so hard to save themselves and authorities failed them too. By waiting two days the girls were probably completely lost. They probably should have stopped moving when they realised they were lost but I bet they walked really far from where they were supposed to be and that’s why they weren’t found. I hope they rest in peace",

        "text": "Theory:\n\nWhen the girls reached the end of the trail the girls began to walk back.  On the way back they encountered Feliciano Gonzalez and friends(maybe including his son and Plineo Montenegro). Feliciano started to molest them and threaten them with his machete. He then told them to march on along one of the trails. He menaced Lisanne with his machete and threatened to harm her if Kris ran away. He told Lisanne to take a couple photos of on the trail, so as to have evidence on the camera to show they had continued on the trail. He directed them which way to go until they reached his coffee farm. He took them to a cave or building near or on the farm. He and his friends raped the girls. He tied them up so they could not escape. He may have deliberately hobbled them by dropped something very heavy on their feet. With the girls imprisoned on his farm he returned to Boquete to visit the place where they were staying. The girls had either secreted the phones on their persons or they were left in a place where it was possible for them to gain access to them with care. Maybe Feliciano knew there would be no phone connection. Feliciano and friends returned repeatedly over a period of days to the farm to rape the girls. He gave them some food and water. Finally after a number of days when he had lost interest in them and when the hunt for the girls was picking up he ended up killing them both Kris first and Lisanne later. He planted evidence such as the bones and the backpack. The night time photos, I am not sure, I guess were most likely taken by the men and not the girls as I can't see why Lisanne would take a photo of the back of Kris's head. I would think that most of the remains of the girls are on or near his farm.\n\nThis gives a clear idea of my train of thought. I am not claiming that every  detail is exactly as I describe it, it is possible that some things happened slightly differently.\n\nI think that it is quite inappropriate to harass Mr. Feliciano Gonzalez. Someone is innocent until proven guilty. Having said, from all I know about the case he would be my prime suspect. It is unfortunate that DNA and fingerprints were not analysed. I daresay he selected/planted only the bones which did not have signs of foul play and that is why the other body parts haven't been discovered. Has anyone taken DNA samples from Feliciano or taken his fingerprints? If you can find his DNA or fingerprints where they aren't supposed to be according to his story then you have got something. For example, his DNA or fingerprints should not be on Kris's shorts as supposedly they were not found by him. I would suspect that his DNA is all over the items in their backpack much more so than if he just found it. It might be possible to find traces of his DNA on bones that were found by others. Where are these items of evidence now: the bones, the shoe, the backpack etc. ?\n\nHis farm should be thoroughly searched and where appropriate tested for fingerprints and DNA, even the slightest evidence that could show that the girls had been on or near that farm would be crucial.",

You won't switch constantly, the photos have been rearranged. The timestamps don't make sense, for example having their hair up and down only seconds apart.

One of their mothers said her son told her he saw the girls in their red pickup truck. He drowned suspiciously. The taxi driver who took them to the trail also drowned suspiciously. Another gang member confessed to the mother he killed her son. He was run over suspiciously. There was a female witness, a girlfriend of the gang, who fled to Costa Rica after telling police the gang killed the girls. This information is out there if you look.",

        "text": "I see this case was covered fairly recently this year. I looked into this last year during lockdown and it was haunting and morbidly fascinated me. \n- My overriding conclusion is the same: that they set off on the trail. Kris was injured to the head I think (Lisanne may have tried to take a photo). Perhaps they both fell = Kris hit head, lisanne broke arm? Then they tried to take photos so natives or search parties would see them. I believe they sheltered on a rock ledge near the river slope. The twigs with plastic bag was an attempt to document where they had been - and feeble because Lisanne was injured herself perhaps. Kris may have had a worse head injury than anticipated and lost consciousness, causing lisanne to panic and try to guess pin code to Kris's phone. This was unsuccessful. Then I theorise that Lisanne, or both of them, came to an extreme conclusion which ultimately ended their lives = perhaps Lisanne, though herself injured, tried to carry kris but slipped and both perished in the river. Perhaps they somehow deludedly thought they could float down river quicker and easier than walking to safety? As to the remains being found: I believe perhaps natives found the backpack and placed it neatly with other strewn garments. The bleached bones and strewn remains may have spoke to my aforementioned theory that lisanne was trying to carry Kris down the river somehow, but both ultimately perished in the river. They may have even felt guilty they didn't find the girls themselves and so gathered certain items, bone fragments, remains etc and piled them together to be found.\n\nThe haunting aspect, more haunting than the above theory they were tragically killed by misfortune and misadventure, is that you can't rule out that they were intercepted by someone and killed. Not a serial killer perhaps....But an amoral killer, maybe even someone with learning difficulties who lives with the natives or nearby and saw two pretty girls as prey. Or more sinister still a guide who killed them by mistake or out of emotional conflict. That image being deleted is quite incriminating. Though again, I can still imagine maybe the girls even deleted it because it showed them in distress and they didn't want loved ones to see that in the photos if found.",

You should be crazy to do that.\n The fact that the last picture of Kris was taken at the creek doesn't mean that they continued their hike from there further into the woods and later tried to attempt the first emergency call even deeper from there. There's no evidence for that.  I'm sure they were already in trouble when the last three pictures of Kris were taken and most likely not taken by Lisanne. Why would she have taken such pictures of Kris? And for a week after that, there are no pictures. It makes no sense unless it's because they were already in big trouble there. Kris' legs and shorts are muddy in the pictures. I think this  is a very important detail. In one picture, she stands with his back to the camera.  Is it believable that Lisanne was the photographer? Why would it have been like? And the picture about Kris front of a cave (?) speaks for itself. It was as if she had cried out. How can someone claim these to be normal pictures?",

        "text": "In the end, I think they let themselves be trapped by the arrival of night.\nAfter photo 508, I think Lisanne dropped her camera on the ground or in the water. Making it unusable. Despite everything, they continued a little on the trail and at one point they decided to go back but they saw that the light was dropping very quickly in certain portions since we are in the tropics and the sun rises at 6:00 in the morning and goes to bed at 6:00 p.m. all year round.\nThey are therefore on their way back but they realize that they need at least two or three hours of walking and a large part of this walk will have to take place at night. They worry because they know the places they have already passed and know that without a flashlight, in the dark of night, it is very difficult and distressing.\nThat’s when they try to call for help, if only to say where they are because they didn’t tell anyone in the end. They just said they were going for a walk.\nBut impossible to contact anyone: no network.\nAt that moment, they were not injured, nor pursued by anyone, just anxious at the idea of ​​returning at night. The wisest thing would have been to land somewhere in open ground and resolve to spend the night there and leave the next morning at first light. In a video, the mother of Kriss who came on the trail explains that she is absolutely sure that if one of the girls had been injured, they would have stayed on the trail and waited. The problem actually is that he There was no injury or other, only from being trapped by the time and the arrival of night, and also from not having warned anyone.\n\nI think that by trying to retrace the path at night, she had a high chance of getting lost, falling, slipping, etc. Which at night reinforces the seriousness of the situation.\nSo they get lost. And the second catastrophe arrives, no one knows where they went or more precisely, no one knows that they continued beyond the Mirador, towards the North on the path. So by the time we organize the research, a lot of time will pass. And we will have to wait until April 6 for research to be done on the other side of the Mirador. That is to say that the girls got lost, that they continued to move during these 6 days, if only to try to find a place with a little network. And obviously in 6 days, without food or very little (?), without water except that of the river (risk of diarrhea that one of the girls already had not long before during the stay), without being able to make a fire. Fear, anxiety, stress, exhaustion...etc. When the search begins beyond the Mirador, the girls are already in a bad state in my opinion.\n\nOn April 8, they have been in the jungle for 7 days! It is said that you can survive 3 minutes without breathing, 3 days without drinking and 3 weeks without eating. I think they were in the state of people who go on hunger strike. They must have remained in bed, half lucid. One may be more affected than the other.\nOn the night of April 8, they heard noise, perhaps light signals in the sky or something else coming from the search teams. I think Lisanne understands that you have to try something to stand out. They are obviously in no condition to scream or anything. So she takes out the camera which she had put to dry and which she had not tried to get it working again since. And it works again. This is possible if the device fell into water and was quickly removed from the water. In time he can works again. So she decides to use it to make flash shots towards the sky. Obviously it takes photos at the same time but the goal is the flash.\nShe is exhausted and at the same time held by the hope of being seen. She awkwardly directs the flash towards the ground a few times which causes her to accidentally take a photo of Kriss' hair who is probably lying sleepy next to her or her head on Lisanne's legs.\nBut it doesn't work, the noises and signals go away. The only hope for days has vanished. We didn't see them.\n\nI think they end up dying of exhaustion and hunger. Not necessarily at the same time.\n\nSubsequently, the rainy season set in, causing rivers to swell and causing flooding. Their bodies were carried away by the waves, disintegrating as they decomposed....\n\nRQ / *Contrary to what has often been said, the bag was dirty and damp when they found it. The items they contained were also damp and the devices were unusable. The Dutch experts had difficulty using them; it was easier with SD cards.\n*The fact that the young women took off their bras appears normal  considering the conditions in which they were (heat, humidity, etc.).\n*The shorts again were not found dry and folded neatly on a stone. It was dirty, wet and with holes.\n*There have never been 70 pin code attempts in 1 day as has been said. In fact it was the Dutch experts who determined that since the phone was put into service, there had been 70 unsuccessful pin code attempts. That is to say that since the girl had been using her cell phone, it had happened to her 70 times of making a mistake when typing your code.\n*There has never been a scrap of human flesh found with bones, which seemed impossible as decomposition would have made it disappear very quickly. In fact this scrap of flesh was analyzed and it was beef.",

I was on the fence about this one, until you hear that people who came forward with information ended up dead too. This reeks of exerted power.\n\nThe emergency calls were probably done in their pockets in secret, trying to quietly get help. The night photos could have been in panic after running in the dark, trying to see where they were going, or one of them fell down a cliff, and the the other took pictures trying to see where she had landed in the photo - not to actually try and see her with the flash because you'd just turn the flashlight on if that were the case.\n\nThe deleted picture was probably one of the captors, who are no strangers to cleaning out phones.\n\nWhy not just trash the phone completely?\nBecause its possible part of the goal of these trafficking cases is, in my opinion, attempting to make sure it looks like no trafficking was involved.\n\nWhy has the investigation not released the last photo?\nFew reasons - Ongoing investigation into who/what it shows, gore, nudity, or corruption.",

Du coup le sens de la photo serait prise à la verticale alors que le corps est par terre, sur le flan droit.

However, how can you explain the order of the photos taken on 1rst april ? the number 508 has been taken almost one hour the pik, so it doesn't match with your theory that the girls could get back. Do you think it is possible with a computer to changer  the order of the photos ? Thx for your answer :)",

        "text": "Kremers was the killer. It was always Kremers from the very start. jealousy, envy and hate are at the heart of this case. it is Kerscher and Knox in the jungle. Kremers was indeed a marvellous actress and she played the role of a lifetime in pursuading the naive and empathic Froon that she was her new \"bestie\". as much as Knox despised Kerscher, Arias depised Alexander and mertens despised corbett, so it came to pass that Kremers despised Froon. Kremers would plan the necessary demise of her empathic rival, her arch nemesis Froon well in advance. Kremers work pre kill is generally very good. She makes the decision early and correctly that it cannot happen on dutch soil, too many obstacles, lack of a viable kill zone, more competent police officers. Kremers uses Froon's pending graduation as an excuse to promote an adventure abroad. Kremers was in Peru previously but Froon had never been further than southern germany. Through a series of subtle manipulations Kremers pursuades not only Froon but Froon's family that the trip will be fine. Getting Froon out of holland is the first and most important thing. Most of Kremers work PRE KILL is in general very very good and she brings her A game to the table. POST KILL is a different matter and this in my view is down to youth and inexperience. Kremers is only 21 and this is a first kill scenario. This can happen with female killers in particular. Hubers notoriously never got passed her 911 call, Arias stupidly left the camera in the washing machine. Kremers would more or less fall into the same trap. On the positive side, there are some nice touches PRE KILL. The date of april fools day as the nominated kill date is ingenius. theirs was a fake friendship, Kremers an imaginary friend, a made up thing in Froon's head. the date is hugely hugely significant. Kremers has correctly considered the issue of WEIGHT on the day. She ensures only one backpack is taken and that it is lightly packed. this shows that she was still in A game mode on the morning of the hike. she knows that she cannot manage two backpacks and Froon at the same time. Kremers, who after the debacle with the school would have been in self congratulatory mood nearly made a fundamental error. Kremers has miscalculated that anyone would find it odd that her and Froon would go on the hike unaccompanied. Here Kremers has noticed considerable pushback from locals including guides that such a trip would be undertaken alone. Kremers nearly misses a beat here. what should have been a minor manipulation to orchestrate the trip with Froon has suddenly become problematic. Kremers has to manipulate a \"back off\" maneouver which will have the necessary effect of having not only the host convinced but any guides or other locals querying the hike that they ARE NOT going alone. Kremers books a guide for April 2 to undertake the trail. this is good but she should have booked a different walk and not the same one. April 1 - fools day. Today is the day all be revealed  Kremers and Froon get a taxi to the beginning of the main trail. Kremers is a bit cocky here in my view as the driver (depending on what is said in the taxi) may have alerted the now fatally compromised Froon that it was \"madness\" to go on the walk without a guide. nonetheless they both exit and begin the walk. Kremers would know by now that she was virtually home and hosed barring some completely unforseen event. It is vital for Kremers to keep up the fake facade for only a little while longer. However this is proving difficult. Kremers is getting very excited, she has fantazied about this for months. Kremers and Froon approach the summit. Kremers is left with one final subtle manipulation. Getting Froon off trail. Kremers will use the fact that the walk itself was uneventful and that no guide was ever required. a simple ruse by locals to earn money. Froon fatally falls again for Kremers manipulations. Once off trail Froon will never be photographed again. In Kremers mind Froon by now an irrelevancy, a figure of fun, a fool. by a series of subtle lies and manipulations over many months she had drawn her prey to her own death. Froon either consciously or unconsciously had the wherewithall to take those final few pictures of Kremers showing the slow and gradual transformation of Kremers from Jekyl to Hyde. the pictures of Kremers show a dominant figure posing with authority. no longer do we see cheesy smiles and hand gestures that mimic her empathic rival. we are beyond that now. the real self will emerge, the monster unleased. I am often asked if Froon knew of her fate. I believe Yes that in those final minutes Froon did indeed know something was seriously wrong with Kremers and she would have been very concerned. Froon left her evidence on her phone and Kremers who was not as smart as she thought she was,  stupidly only deleted the attack photo when she should have deleted all the off trail pictures. the last surviving photo should have been at the summit on the main trail. This would have created a much more enticing narrative.",

        "text": "No fool play.\nIn the end, I think they let themselves be trapped by the arrival of night.\nAfter photo 508, I think Lisanne dropped her camera on the ground or in the water. Making it unusable. Despite everything, they continued a little on the trail and at one point they decided to go back but they saw that the light was dropping very quickly in certain portions since we are in the tropics and the sun rises at 6:00 in the morning and goes to bed at 6:00 p.m. all year round.\nThey are therefore on their way back but they realize that they need at least two or three hours of walking and a large part of this walk will have to take place at night. They worry because they know the places they have already passed and know that without a flashlight, in the dark of night, it is very difficult and distressing.\nThat’s when they try to call for help, if only to say where they are because they didn’t tell anyone in the end. They just said they were going for a walk.\nBut impossible to contact anyone: no network.\nAt that moment, they were not injured, nor pursued by anyone, just anxious at the idea of ​​returning at night. The wisest thing would have been to land somewhere in open ground and resolve to spend the night there and leave the next morning at first light. In a video, the mother of Kriss who came on the trail explains that she is absolutely sure that if one of the girls had been injured, they would have stayed on the trail and waited. The problem actually is that he There was no injury or other, only from being trapped by the time and the arrival of night, and also from not having warned anyone.\n\nI think that by trying to retrace the path at night, she had a high chance of getting lost, falling, slipping, etc. Which at night reinforces the seriousness of the situation.\nSo they get lost. And the second catastrophe arrives, no one knows where they went or more precisely, no one knows that they continued beyond the Mirador, towards the North on the path. So by the time we organize the research, a lot of time will pass. And we will have to wait until April 6 for research to be done on the other side of the Mirador. That is to say that the girls got lost, that they continued to move during these 6 days, if only to try to find a place with a little network. And obviously in 6 days, without food or very little (?), without water except that of the river (risk of diarrhea that one of the girls already had not long before during the stay), without being able to make a fire. Fear, anxiety, stress, exhaustion...etc. When the search begins beyond the Mirador, the girls are already in a bad state in my opinion.\n\nOn April 8, they have been in the jungle for 7 days! It is said that you can survive 3 minutes without breathing, 3 days without drinking and 3 weeks without eating. I think they were in the state of people who go on hunger strike. They must have remained in bed, half lucid. One may be more affected than the other.\nOn the night of April 8, they heard noise, perhaps light signals in the sky or something else coming from the search teams. I think Lisanne understands that you have to try something to stand out. They are obviously in no condition to scream or anything. So she takes out the camera which she had put to dry and which she had not tried to get it working again since. And it works again. This is possible if the device fell into water and was quickly removed from the water. In time he can works again. So she decides to use it to make flash shots towards the sky. Obviously it takes photos at the same time but the goal is the flash.\nShe is exhausted and at the same time held by the hope of being seen. She awkwardly directs the flash towards the ground a few times which causes her to accidentally take a photo of Kriss' hair who is probably lying sleepy next to her or her head on Lisanne's legs.\nBut it doesn't work, the noises and signals go away. The only hope for days has vanished. We didn't see them.\n\nI think they end up dying of exhaustion and hunger. Not necessarily at the same time.\n\nSubsequently, the rainy season set in, causing rivers to swell and causing flooding. Their bodies were carried away by the waves, disintegrating as they decomposed....\n\nRQ / *Contrary to what has often been said, the bag was dirty and damp when they found it. The items they contained were also damp and the devices were unusable. The Dutch experts had difficulty using them; it was easier with SD cards.\n*The fact that the young women took off their bras appears normal  considering the conditions in which they were (heat, humidity, etc.).\n*The shorts again were not found dry and folded neatly on a stone. It was dirty, wet and with holes.\n*There have never been 70 pin code attempts in 1 day as has been said. In fact it was the Dutch experts who determined that since the phone was put into service, there had been 70 unsuccessful pin code attempts. That is to say that since the girl had been using her cell phone, it had happened to her 70 times of making a mistake when typing your code.\n*There has never been a scrap of human flesh found with bones, which seemed impossible as decomposition would have made it disappear very quickly. In fact this scrap of flesh was analyzed and it was beef.",

Somewhere before making it home they were abducted and killed. They were later returned back to the trail (or further into the forest) along with their belongings (which is why everything was in good shape) some claim her shorts were floating down the river, not folded. Which also would make no sense unless recently left and they were also not in bad condition. The parents believe Whoever killed them took the photos and also was responsible for the unknown passcode to the phone and photos. There is a very good recent video from 4 months ago that is very informative with a ton of news clips, photos, parents opinions etc.. the dog actually followed them from a local restaurant at the trailhead and did this often. So, the dog returning without them was actually not abnormal as he ran the trail daily. When the families went to Panama, they timed out the treck on that trail and found that what the government claimed was impossible in almost every way. I am definitely more inclined to believe this theory. Also, many many many tourist have gone missing in Panama and this area.",

You should only use convenience numbers like 911 if you're using a landline phone that does not follow this international convention. Second, and largely unanswered is how the girls managed to keep their phone running for so long off of battery. I doubt the iPhone/Galaxy phone could take hundreds of photos, make a few emergency calls, and be power cycled on and off for 8 days. Unless they had an external battery pack, which in early 2014 wasn't as prevalent as they were today, something doesn't add up. My guess is their phone remained powered on during the first day, then the perpetrator keep the phone powered on to lead investigators astray. Another thing: how come several calls to 112 lead to no answer? My understanding is that emergency numbers generally should work, even in more remote areas. It's one of the few things that actually you can somewhat count on. Unsure what the cell infrastructure was over there at that time, but it does seem bizarre that they'd try many times over a course of several days and not once did their call get connected. Taking a photo to activate the flash to see where you're going seems a bit strange, although I suppose in 2014 flashlight capability wasn't built in to all phones. However, it does seem a bit strange that again they would have the battery power to take all those photos, even activating flash and it all lasting several days. Another thing, why didn't they just wait till the following day for sunlight to descend from where they were and seek help? The most dangerous time to be moving is night time without any illumination.",

        "text": "It seems we are closer than ever before to finding what actually happened. The only way to know is to first find the night location where the pictures were taken in a hope to reconstruct the most logical path taken from there back to the trail. There is a general location which is being hypothesized as the most likely, which is on one of the rivers in a large valley that is to the East of the trail. It looks like the most likely thing that happened was the girls went pretty far down the other side of the mirador, but not all the way to the monkey bridges. It's not exactly clear how far they went, because they could have also taken a long stop by one of the streams, for example. The important part is that by the time they decided to head back they no longer had enough time to make the full trail before they lost visibility on the track due to the sun going down. On April 1st, the sun would go down fully roughly around 6:40 pm, though the girls didn't have that long. The trail would be enveloped by darkness considerably earlier than that since the sun would be blocked out by the mountains at some point, and only a portion of that light would make it thru the dense canopy of the forest. Anyone that's been in a forest during sunset knows what I mean; it can still be really bright outside the treeline but as soon as you start walking deeper in it feels like the sun has completely went down. It is likely that due to this, they left the trail and ended up finding a river that starts around this point, about half-way back up to the Mirador. If they went the West on that river, the direction of the trail they came from, they would find their path blocked by a large 10 meter high waterfall, which they couldn't realistically scale. This means it is more likely that they decided to follow the river East instead of going back into the jungle and trying to retrace their steps to the trail. Eventually that river turns into a series of rapids and smaller cascading waterfalls, which they would be on the top end of. Since there was barely any water in the river on April 1st, there is a good chance they tried making their way further down so they could continue following the river. It is likely one of them got hurt at this point, probably Lisanne, whose ankle showed that it was broken in three places. They continued a while further but at a certain point stopped and set up that camp we saw in the night photos. This would be April 8th so they would both be exhausted and hungry from not eating for a week at this point. Lisanne also had an infection from an inflamed femur which suggested she had been walking for a very long time, so it is less likely that the injury occurred very early on into the trip. It's likely Kris carried Lisanne for a while but she too eventually became exhausted from the lack of food. They most likely stayed in that night location where they set up the SOS signal and the reflective surface which was the bottom of a pringles can. The flag/marker they made was most likely at first a red bag over a branch which later got torn and became what we see in the photo. Kris and Lisanne seemed to be in a small area that provided some shelter from the rain, like a little cove at the bottom of an embankment where a steep hill meets the river shore. The flag was just tall enough to stick up over a boulder if leaned against it, which is probably where they left it when they were sleeping in case searchers were walking down the river and didn't see them. No one has searched this area yet as it is pretty far away and really dangerous to cross during wet seasons due to the strong currents. It doesn't seem anyone searched that river at all in time to have saved the girls either, but a Dutch team did go down that river in 2015 only to stop at the rapids/waterfalls. Kris and Lisanne couldnt have realistically made their way back up those falls either once they got down, especially if one of them was badly injured at that point. The area the night photos were taken also must flood during the wet season which explains why their remains and belongings were carried further down the river a few months later.",

Also, why is the last photo of Kris’s hair so CLEAN... after 11 days in the Rainforest, sleeping on rocks and dirt, the sweltering heat, her hair would’ve been sweaty, greasy, and probably bits of dirt, leaves, sediment... that was freshly washed hair! The bones could’ve been picked clean by carnivorous insects and predatory animals. But their deaths were no accident, someone was calling on their phones to reach emergency services for days, and they didn’t attempt to call for almost entire days after trying and failing, 14 hours is a long time to wait on trying to call for help again... Unless, you are being held captive, and cannot call often for fear of the captor taking the phones. So mysterious. These girls and their families need justice and truth, so tragic.",

        "text": "In the end, I think they let themselves be trapped by the arrival of night.\n\nAfter photo 508, I think Lisanne dropped her camera on the ground or in the water. Making it unusable. Despite everything, they continued a little on the trail and at one point they decided to go back but they saw that the light was dropping very quickly in certain portions since we are in the tropics and the sun rises at 6:00 in the morning and goes to bed at 6:00 p.m. all year round.\nThey are therefore on their way back but they realize that they need at least two or three hours of walking and a large part of this walk will have to take place at night. They worry because they know the places they have already passed and know that without a flashlight, in the dark of night, it is very difficult and distressing.\nThat’s when they try to call for help, if only to say where they are because they didn’t tell anyone in the end. They just said they were going for a walk.\nBut impossible to contact anyone: no network.\nAt that moment, they were not injured, nor pursued by anyone, just anxious at the idea of ​​returning at night. The wisest thing would have been to land somewhere in open ground and resolve to spend the night there and leave the next morning at first light. In a video, the mother of Kriss who came on the trail explains that she is absolutely sure that if one of the girls had been injured, they would have stayed on the trail and waited. The problem actually is that he There was no injury or other, only from being trapped by the time and the arrival of night, and also from not having warned anyone.\n\nI think that by trying to retrace the path at night, she had a high chance of getting lost, falling, slipping, etc. Which at night reinforces the seriousness of the situation.\nSo they get lost. And the second catastrophe arrives, no one knows where they went or more precisely, no one knows that they continued beyond the Mirador, towards the North on the path. So by the time we organize the research, a lot of time will pass. And we will have to wait until April 6 for research to be done on the other side of the Mirador. That is to say that the girls got lost, that they continued to move during these 6 days, if only to try to find a place with a little network. And obviously in 6 days, without food or very little (?), without water except that of the river (risk of diarrhea that one of the girls already had not long before during the stay), without being able to make a fire. Fear, anxiety, stress, exhaustion...etc. When the search begins beyond the Mirador, the girls are already in a bad state in my opinion.\n\nOn April 8, they have been in the jungle for 7 days! It is said that you can survive 3 minutes without breathing, 3 days without drinking and 3 weeks without eating. I think they were in the state of people who go on hunger strike. They must have remained in bed, half lucid. One may be more affected than the other.\nOn the night of April 8, they heard noise, perhaps light signals in the sky or something else coming from the search teams. I think Lisanne understands that you have to try something to stand out. They are obviously in no condition to scream or anything. So she takes out the camera which she had put to dry and which she had not tried to get it working again since. And it works again. This is possible if the device fell into water and was quickly removed from the water. In time he can works again. So she decides to use it to make flash shots towards the sky. Obviously it takes photos at the same time but the goal is the flash.\nShe is exhausted and at the same time held by the hope of being seen. She awkwardly directs the flash towards the ground a few times which causes her to accidentally take a photo of Kriss' hair who is probably lying sleepy next to her or her head on Lisanne's legs.\nBut it doesn't work, the noises and signals go away. The only hope for days has vanished. We didn't see them.\n\nI think they end up dying of exhaustion and hunger. Not necessarily at the same time.\n\nSubsequently, the rainy season set in, causing rivers to swell and causing flooding. Their bodies were carried away by the waves, disintegrating as they decomposed....\n\nRQ / *Contrary to what has often been said, the bag was dirty and damp when they found it. The items they contained were also damp and the devices were unusable. The Dutch experts had difficulty using them; it was easier with SD cards.\n*The fact that the young women took off their bras appears normal  considering the conditions in which they were (heat, humidity, etc.).\n*The shorts again were not found dry and folded neatly on a stone. It was dirty, wet and with holes.\n*There have never been 70 pin code attempts in 1 day as has been said. In fact it was the Dutch experts who determined that since the phone was put into service, there had been 70 unsuccessful pin code attempts. That is to say that since the girl had been using her cell phone, it had happened to her 70 times of making a mistake when typing your code.\n*There has never been a scrap of human flesh found with bones, which seemed impossible as decomposition would have made it disappear very quickly. In fact this scrap of flesh was analyzed and it was beef.",

I believed these girls was stalked and murdered by something not human something that even the authorities over there are probably covering up. Where's the photo that was taken of a pair of red glowing eyes in the background in the woods, which explains the worried look on the girls faces in later photos. I believe the photos was for evidence of what was chasing them that day which explains the absence of the other girls backpack. The absence of her backpack was either to get rid of it to run faster or she left it behind on accident in a hurry to escape an attack. Idk it's highly strange no one ever mentioned or thought of this but only God knows. 👍🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾",

Maybe that will make it clearer how far they could went on or back on the trail and if there some possibilities for an accident. My thought was maybe they went off the trail by their own will and go along the riverbed to explore the area. There are 2 rivercrossings if iam right. Quebrada 1 which is the one in the photo? and quebrada 2, right? What if they explore the riverbed and fall from a cliff or found a waterfall ( I read about a hidden waterfall not far away from the trail but far enough away that nobody would recognize someone who had an accident ) it would make sense in my opinion. The two women were adventerous, curious and taking risks. They went on hiking past the mirador (photo proof)  The hiking scout warned and told them to don't do it on their own but they do. If one of them fall down and got injured bad (broken pelvis)  maybe the other try to get to her and got hurt too (broken foot). Now on a lower terrain and injured they cannot climb back and stay on some big rock and try to make some signals with their stuff outer their backpacks but nobody search for them is this area and nobody could hear her screams for help because of the loud sound of the water and the deep forest terrain. When the water rises their bodies would go with the stream and thats the reason they found the remains and backpack downstream the river.",

Seulement je m'étonne d'une chose: n'aurait-il pas été plus simple pour les ravisseurs de simplement détruire simplement l'appareil photo plutôt que de se donner autant de mal à  effacer la photo 509 et aussi de penser à faire ces 80 photos de nuit?\n Pourquoi une telle mise en scène? Cela semble bien trop réfléchi de la part de ce genre d'individus... \nBref, cette histoire est en effet digne d'un film d'horreur et j'ai beaucoup de peine pour ces deux jeunes femmes qui étaient pleines de vie et pour leur famille...\nMerci pour la vidéo Lionel.",

Pourquoi les individus responsable de leur mort iraient supprimer cette unique photo avec une manip de fou sur un PC alors qu'ils leur suffisait de détruire la carte mémoire? Je trouve ça quand même un peu tiré par les cheveux. Pareil pour la chaux, pourquoi disperser des parties du corps avec cet élément incriminant alors qu'ils suffisait d'enterrer les corps ou les brûler. Dans des zones aussi reculer c'est pas ce qu'il y a de plus compliqué. Bref cette théorie a tout du bon scénar' de film policier, mais en vrai, j'ai des doutes.\n\nA mon avis l'explication est beaucoup plus terre à terre. Les filles se sont perdue ou se sont bléssées (du moins l'une d'entre elle), elle ont appelé les secours, mais n'ayant aucun signal elles ont économisé la batterie. Plus tard Kriss meurt, Lisanne n'ayant plus accès à son portable tante d'utiliser celui de Kriss, sans succès, faute de code pin. Puis vient l'épisode de l'appareil photo, sans doute une tentative de se faire remarquer ou alors une technique pour se repérer dans le noir. Enfin Lisanne fini par périr suite à une chute ou tout autre accident sans doute à cause de l'épuisement. \n\nPour les recherche c'est assez facilement explicable tout simplement parce que c'est très, très difficile de retrouver des personnes perdues, même en France. Il suffit de regarder des reportages sur des équipes de secours ou de recherche comme la sécurité civile pour s'en convaincre. Alors au Panama, dans des zones reculés avec une forêt dense, sans réseaux, sans route... voilà quoi.\n\nQuoi qu'il en soit ayons une pensée pour ces jeunes filles et leur famille. Ce genre d'histoire me glace le sang qu'elle soit criminelle ou accidentelle.",

The dryer and hotter the weather the more quickly this happens. This would also make sense that one set of bones were bleached but others were not considering they were spread out in different areas they would be exposed in different ways causing decaying states to vary. Also some parts of Panama have higher levels of lime in the soil this also affects the rate of decay and the sterilisation of the bones.\n\nAnimals could of easily moved the bones around.",

Because of the thumbs.\nThese locals took the women to some other place, maybe on a higher altitude. Because of the tension and the illumination of there bodies and the sunglasses and sunprotection. And because of the reflection in the glasses.\nThey took the women to another staying, maybe another hostel, maybe deeper in the jungle. Because their cellphones couldn't made any contact anymore. But the only few tryings for calling 911 indicates that they felt in relatively safety. The anxiety level wasn't very high.\nMaybe they were misled, maybe told not to make photos about the place.\nMaybe they were kept in false safety and gave the camera away freely to be modified to cover up the escapade.\nBut they were uncertain and checked regularely if they could call 911, if they had to. The possibility to enter the codes indicates that they were alive.\nBut at one point, they decide to run away. Because the call-times and the date of the night-photos correlates.\nMaybe they had only the camera with em and let the phones behind. Someone found it and maybe tried to call 911 himself.\nThen on the run the accident happened. Not murder, because of the appearance of the Belongings later on.\nMaybe they were at a higher altitude with higher cliffs and lower temperatures and therefor died from Hypothermia.\nMaybe the guys later on found the women and tried to cover the hole thing up. To avoid the police.\nAfter hearing of the reward, some of them probably wanted to make a business out of it. And others even planned to speak up.\nWhat made the rest panicken. Thatwhy the aftermath deaths. \nThe clothes puzzle is now simple: They changed their clothes because their images in the day-photos were from another day and another place.",

Do you really believe that they wouldn't have tried to use the camera at all over such a long period of time had they been alive and by themselves? As others have mentioned, if they had no supplies, food or fresh water, it's likely that they would have already been dead when those pictures were taken anyways.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm pretty sure that given their situation, Kris would have told Lisanne her PIN number at some point between April 1st and April 5th. If Kris was no longer responsive (or dead) by April 6th, Lisanne should have known the PIN number and therefore wouldn't have had that many failed attempts on the security screen.

This suggests that at some time late on April 1st, both girls felt the need to liberate themselves. On basically all photos showing Lisanne, a bra strap is partially visible. Based on previous photos, the girls would wear a bra whenever they were in a public setting; this included moving along the trail for all we know. After image #508 (and #509?), they must have considered themselves out of public view and not expected to snap additional photos. Clearly, they would be off the trail, but where and why? Did the girls veer off the beaten path just after #508 to maybe take a dip, or did they head back? If they were confronted and forced off the path, how did their bras end up in the backpack? This detail continues to bother me.",

Thats why the last photo of Chris looking back saying \"hey are you sure we can get back in time your not getting us lost are you?\" as far as the bones the bacteria, leeches and various small worms and other things would have cleaned off the bones very fast especially considering alternate wet and dry and flash floods washing them down. Its panama people want to picture lions and ignore bacteria and such. I am avid hiker and even when finding bones in the desert infested with coyotes--even among coyote skulls NOT ONCE have a seen any bones with chew marks. But to clean off a skull or bones such as big horn sheep the only way to do it is leave it out or bury it in leaves and such and forget it for a month. The various bugs will for a fact even get into the tiny sinuses and passages and eat everything even tendons and disks between vertabrae which would make the bones more easily fall apart during the flash floods. lost people found eventually if in or near water OFTEN are missing their heads. another video the best--they even brought in expert retired life long finding people and bodies and he made it clear what he saw is EXACTLY how they are found. yet everyone visualizes lions and coyotes ripping them apart--never bacteria and other tiny flesh eating things since they insulate the public from it. The first distress and almost certain injury from their many falls HAPPENED FAST. Chris certainly was the first to finally succumb and BOTH certainly had various falls of all types. Back of chris head with flash was likely to try to inspect an injury-THEN it became desperate. why was photo deleted and bras tucked away they likely were wet and YES in desperation they likely huddled naked in the cold. perhaps delirious perhaps one of the desperation photos had nudity in it? who knows. shorts on the rock? perhaps not skinny dipping Chris could have been already dead and they were left as another marker. They simply got disoriented and possibly thought they were heading back towards the town. absolutely falling injuries--note they did not really travel that far.",

Unfortunately, they checked every box for people that are looking to sell human organs on the black market (and they were young, vulnerable women). There's a lot of money to be made from selling human organs (from what I hear). It just never made sense to me about the bleached bones and some of the conditions that the remains were found in.  That's really the only thing I can think of that makes some sort of sense.  The bookbag was weird and seemed like a set up. Two bras, two pairs of sunglasses, and so on. So weird.  Who packs 2 bras for a hike? And what about the phone calls and all of the times that \"someone \" tried unlocking the phone(s)..? Don't get me started on the deleted photo. The photo that could have only been deleted in a very specific way. It was all too weird & it seemed like the government was trying to protect someone, or at the very least, they wanted tourism to continue.  🤔",

        "text": "So, a couple things to note.  Scavenger animals could easily have caused the vast distances of the bones.  It could also explain the bleaching, if the bone was picked clean and left in the sun long enough.  Without more details, that's hard to say.  Am I saying with confidence that this was the case, no.   But, it is a reason they could have concluded an accidental death.  Regarding the bag, that's a tough one.  Assuming the lady that found it was telling the truth, and did not have it longer, it seems someone would have placed it where it was found.  But, they could have found it in a much different way, and only got scared when investigations were happening in their village and just didn't want to be a part of it.  Let's face it, people lie.  \n\nAll in all, it's an interesting case.  Why the picture of the back of the head?  Was it to document what happened, was the flashing being used as a light because they heard something in the wilderness that scared them?  That seems more probable to me.  But, why was a photo deleted?  Very strange and so little information to go on.  These types of cases are just difficult in general.  And since it doesn't seem that a full body was ever found, it's even more difficult to answer.  I am curious why more caves  or outcroppings of rocks were not checked in the jungles near the areas where items were found.  It's clear in the photo that they were in some sort of cave or under some sort of outcropping.  It would be interesting to retrace their steps based on their photos as best as possible.",

Also, it is not uncommon for drug gangs in parts of remote Sth America to be part of Death Cults that engage in human sacrifice in belief that it will bring prosperity. That could explain the state of the bones, and the missing photo. It's a theory. There have been some violent cult sacrifices in Sth America, including in the remote Panamanian jungle.",

I also don’t think it was foul play because their money and cell phones would have been taken. The dry backpack also didn’t float down the river. Common sense tells me that the girls were lost and sought out water when they couldn’t make contact with their phones. That’s why their backpacks were found dry near the river. As the days passed without food and protection from the elements and weakness and illness set in, they became closer to death they became more delirious and were unable to input their own sim codes to unlock their phones due to their deteriorating physical and cognitive states. Animals ate their bodies or perhaps even attacked them while they were still alive. Too much is being made of the incidental details. Photo number 509 may have been deleted by one of the girls right after it was shot and didn’t make it into the photo album. The photo of the back of the one girl’s head is consistent with delirium stetting in or even an attempt by the last surviving girl to document her friend’s death. I would say the difference in the condition of the bones is interesting, but without more information we don’t know if this is significant. Cannibals? Possibly, but again, not likely.  The search helicopters with their heat seeking equipment never saw any trace of them. My final belief is that the girls simply died and their bodies were partially eaten by animals. Who knows how long the other bones supposedly from other people had been there. May be unrelated to this case.",

Because they didnt have flash lights and were using the camera for the flash to see what was ahead. Unfortunately it also made it easy for whoever was tracking them. The last photo i believe was them hearing noise from behind them  and they happened to get a picture of whoever killed them. They werent out there that lomg before thimgs went wrong. Only reason for distress calls and going that far is because of 1 thing. Fear.

        "text": "This is the best doc I have seen on the case of dutch girls in Panama. Really impressive. Now I am 95% sure it wasn´t a kidnaping and a murder. If they were murdered, most likely that their bodies and backpack with passport and personal belongings would have been buried or at least hid by the murderer in the forest. Or money, phones, and camera stollen. And no help phone calls would have been made for so many days, and also photos in the dark would not have been taken one week after dissapearance. These numerous and some what absurd flash photos were most probably made in a delirious and panic state in order to drive away some animal at night after having heard frightening noises or bushes moving in the jungle. In my opinion, a relatively minor accident like a twisted ankle by one of the girls after imprudently having left the main trail (and getting disoriented) could have been enough to unchain the missfortuned set of events that led to their death. But, on the other hand, the more I think about it... Why didn´t the girls take a single photo or video of themselves (except a hair closeup) with the camera (no battery problem) after the first couple of hours? That´s really odd and strange. So maybe I´m not so sure that there was no foul play after all...",

The night pictures have been analyzed and shown to have all been taken close together facing the same direction for the most part.\n\nApril 8th, the day of the night photos was the first day of major rain in the area. Its also obvious that it was raining in many of the pictures, extremely heavily. What if they slept in a bad spot that washed out or they were forced off a hillside by moving water. In the fall kris was possibly injured and the girls were disoriented. The night photos were taken as a way to get some grasp of where they were and to check kris' injury. The next day they stripped off their clothes to dry them out and something unfortunate happened causing them to wash down the river, whether an accident or devious people. \n\nI also suspect that the bag was looted and the thief got scared when the case became more high profile and ditched it. It still doesn't make sense to me that the contents of the bag were dry and undamaged however. Perhaps the bag got foubd early on and the last time kris' phone was turned on was the person who found the bag checking the function of the electronics. \n\nIts pretty hard to put any theories together on this case, all the evidence is so unsatisfying. The state of the remains seems unreasonable for natural causes. The bag being found dry and undamaged is weird. The deleted photo is beyond strange. I think whether natural causes or murder, panama wanted people to forget about it real fast.",

Il a même été avancée que les photos du canon avaient été \"photoshopée\". aujourd'hui pour moi, la piste criminelle ne fait plsu aucun doute, votre théorie finale est je pense , malheureusement ce qui a du arriver, et personnellement j ai toujours pensé que la photo 509 avait été effacée par la Police locale, peut etre suite a une erreur ou alors pour coller avec la thèse officielle, car le tourisme est naturellement une source économique pour le pays non négligeable. Le guide pose question aussi , je trouve votre idée de le flouter et de taire son nom très \"professionnel\". Pour conclure sur votre travail, c'est la vidéo ultime de cette dramatique affaire,  et j adhère totalement a vos conclusions. Je pense que par votre travail vous rendez hommage a ces deux jeune filles, et a leur famille paix à leurs âmes ! Bien à vous.",

La lumière de reflète sur les arbres et la végétation et l'on voit alors bien mieux les alentours. Celà donnais évidemment lieu à une serie de photos, vraiment très similaires à la serie de 90 de la vidéo.😐",

        "text": "Excellent work! here is some update on the case. The plausible reconstruction indicates that those responsible include the guide's son (they can investigate him) and his band at that time. They found the girls around the road and they went in a truck (reported by witnesses) to a nearby ranch. They took photos with them at the beginning (photos deleted) and went to the ranch to drink and with the intention of drugging them to seduce them and have \"luck with them.\" The girls resisted and the situation got out of hand, so they ended up beating them to death. In fact, when they became aware of what they had done, it was too late, they dismembered them and then used the camera to plant evidence. The bones were, in fact, subjected to a chemical treatment. The backpack was planted at the scene and the random photos were taken by the perpetrators with the aim of misleading the investigators, not by the girls. Several direct witnesses were indeed killed by this little band. The reason why it was not investigated is a mix of factors ranging from political issues (the ranch, its owner and his connections) and the ineptitude of the Prosecutor at that time (corruption). Many police officers already knew about this. The point is to make the case visible and reopen it. These people now have less power than before and letting this favorable moment pass would be to continue giving a negative message so that these people continue doing things without consequences. We trust that the people of Panama and especially of Boquete can be encouraged to report (with precautions). already through justice or at least add contributions through these social media outlets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiuCAUSY5DI&t=0s",

Final photos are random pictures of the hills and the sky. Probably their, or one of the girls' final moments. Maybe she escaped her killer and was frantically flashing the sky? Anyway, then the killer tries to access the phone, fails, then manages to access it via a computer, and delete the incriminating photo. Why he returned the stuff I don't know though, maybe he was spooked and wanted the search to end?",

My theory is that they encountered someone on the path. I believe the girls went with that person or group of people not really willingly but under the guise that they were willing to try and remain safe which is why they had their phones. \n\nWhen they had a moment in a captive situation they felt was safe they would try to get a call out to no avail. At some point on April 6th or 7th Kim has some episode with one of the assailants and is killed. Lisanne had kept her phone and now is in a panic which is why there are more attempts to activate the phone and she tries multiple times numbers she thought might work, or perhaps thought she knew the code and forgot it. \n\nThe deleted photo had one of the assailants on it so they removed it. The 90 photos were taken somewhere near where they were being held and perhaps have no meaning as there is no reason that the assailants couldn't have just destroyed the phones and camera. \n\nAt some point later Lisanne is also killed when perhaps it gets too dangerous to hold her, maybe they had a close call and made that decision despite Lisanne probably trying to comply in every possible way to stay alive. \n\nI also think authorities know what happened but aren't saying.",

Potentially they were taking them to fill the camera card up so it would ensure the deleted photo was properly erased. Then when they realized it would take too long they just plugged it into a laptop later to full erase the incriminating photo. Just a thought because it's hard to focus night shots if you were in a panic/on the run. And also if you could wouldn't you turn turn the camera around and film a video to explain what was going on? I know that is a little Blair witch but I would want to tell my story if I could...\nAnyhow I know there will be many theories and potential we will never know the answers.",

        "text": "In the end, I think they let themselves be trapped by the arrival of night.\nAfter photo 508, I think Lisanne dropped her camera on the ground or in the water. Making it unusable. Despite everything, they continued a little on the trail and at one point they decided to go back but they saw that the light was dropping very quickly in certain portions since we are in the tropics and the sun rises at 6:00 in the morning and goes to bed at 6:00 p.m. all year round.\nThey are therefore on their way back but they realize that they need at least two or three hours of walking and a large part of this walk will have to take place at night. They worry because they know the places they have already passed and know that without a flashlight, in the dark of night, it is very difficult and distressing.\nThat’s when they try to call for help, if only to say where they are because they didn’t tell anyone in the end. They just said they were going for a walk.\nBut impossible to contact anyone: no network.\nAt that moment, they were not injured, nor pursued by anyone, just anxious at the idea of ​​returning at night. The wisest thing would have been to land somewhere in open ground and resolve to spend the night there and leave the next morning at first light. In a video, the mother of Kriss who came on the trail explains that she is absolutely sure that if one of the girls had been injured, they would have stayed on the trail and waited. The problem actually is that he There was no injury or other, only from being trapped by the time and the arrival of night, and also from not having warned anyone.\n\nI think that by trying to retrace the path at night, she had a high chance of getting lost, falling, slipping, etc. Which at night reinforces the seriousness of the situation.\nSo they get lost. And the second catastrophe arrives, no one knows where they went or more precisely, no one knows that they continued beyond the Mirador, towards the North on the path. So by the time we organize the research, a lot of time will pass. And we will have to wait until April 6 for research to be done on the other side of the Mirador. That is to say that the girls got lost, that they continued to move during these 6 days, if only to try to find a place with a little network. And obviously in 6 days, without food or very little (?), without water except that of the river (risk of diarrhea that one of the girls already had not long before during the stay), without being able to make a fire. Fear, anxiety, stress, exhaustion...etc. When the search begins beyond the Mirador, the girls are already in a bad state in my opinion.\n\nOn April 8, they have been in the jungle for 7 days! It is said that you can survive 3 minutes without breathing, 3 days without drinking and 3 weeks without eating. I think they were in the state of people who go on hunger strike. They must have remained in bed, half lucid. One may be more affected than the other.\nOn the night of April 8, they heard noise, perhaps light signals in the sky or something else coming from the search teams. I think Lisanne understands that you have to try something to stand out. They are obviously in no condition to scream or anything. So she takes out the camera which she had put to dry and which she had not tried to get it working again since. And it works again. This is possible if the device fell into water and was quickly removed from the water. In time he can works again. So she decides to use it to make flash shots towards the sky. Obviously it takes photos at the same time but the goal is the flash.\nShe is exhausted and at the same time held by the hope of being seen. She awkwardly directs the flash towards the ground a few times which causes her to accidentally take a photo of Kriss' hair who is probably lying sleepy next to her or her head on Lisanne's legs.\nBut it doesn't work, the noises and signals go away. The only hope for days has vanished. We didn't see them.\n\nI think they end up dying of exhaustion and hunger. Not necessarily at the same time.\n\nSubsequently, the rainy season set in, causing rivers to swell and causing flooding. Their bodies were carried away by the waves, disintegrating as they decomposed....\n\nRQ / *Contrary to what has often been said, the bag was dirty and damp when they found it. The items they contained were also damp and the devices were unusable. The Dutch experts had difficulty using them; it was easier with SD cards.\n*The fact that the young women took off their bras appears normal  considering the conditions in which they were (heat, humidity, etc.).\n*The shorts again were not found dry and folded neatly on a stone. It was dirty, wet and with holes.\n*There have never been 70 pin code attempts in 1 day as has been said. In fact it was the Dutch experts who determined that since the phone was put into service, there had been 70 unsuccessful pin code attempts. That is to say that since the girl had been using her cell phone, it had happened to her 70 times of making a mistake when typing your code.\n*There has never been a scrap of human flesh found with bones, which seemed impossible as decomposition would have made it disappear very quickly. In fact this scrap of flesh was analyzed and it was beef.",

Tellement de questions sans réponses... je me demande également si l'eau retrouvée dans la bouteille était de l'eau de la rivière ou l'eau qu'elles avaient de base. On ne parle pas non plus de si oui ou non de l'ADN a été retrouvé sur le sac, short, etc. \nEt le fait qu'il y aie si peu d'ossements, ça laisse aussi tellement de possibilités (attaque d'animal, accident, os brisés). \nJe pense sincèrement que si toutes les infos n'ont pas été divulguées c'est pour de \"bonnes\" raisons (peur de la baisse du tourisme, photos ou messages extrêmement choquants ou sensibles, par respect envers les familles, etc). \nC'est humain de vouloir chercher \"pourquoi?\", on veut toujours trouver une réponse et surtout, comprendre. Mais parfois la réponse est tellement dure et cruelle, qu'on refuse de l'accepter. \nPour ma part je pense que c'était un accident. Peut-être qu'elles ont voulu continuer d'explorer en pensant faire demi-tour plus tard, mais qu'une a glissé, ou Lisanne a eu un problème de santé avec ses chevilles, et qu'en effet elles sont restées statiques en tentant de joindre les secours. Et que le lendemain avec le tremblement de terre elles se sont définitivement perdues. \nLe fait qu'il y aie eu un noyé 3 jours après, peut être une coïncidence. Les autres morts aussi, tout comme la photo 509. Finalement on n'a même pas toutes les infos, photos, etc. \nEt le fait que le guide aie passé 2h dans leur chambre ne me choque pas. Dans les pays latins, on parle bcp, on échange longuement. Une expedition ça se prépare et ça se discute, et avec la barrière de la langue ça a aussi pu prendre du temps. Et puis qui témoigne de cette durée? Comment s'est vérifié? Il y a tellement de choses vagues dans cette histoire... \nPour moi c'est une accumulation de conséquences déstastreuses, un accident. \nIl y a aussi la possibilité qu'une des deux filles aie une maladie mentale qui se soit déclarée suite à une chute ou autre. \nBref, on ne saura sûrement jamais. Paix à leur âme et je compatis à l'horreur qu'elles ont dû vivre ❤ \nJe passe le 90% de mon temps seule dans la forêt, mais jamais sans mon chien de garde, qui m'a plusieurs fois protégée de situations houleuses. Il peut se passer tellement de choses... je pense fort à elles❤",

They simply didn't have to to do it, or think about doing it. Still makes you wonder why not document anything later, around the time they did take night time photos and possibly had more time to do it.\nVery mysterious, but indeed suspicious of foul play.

But both just stayed in that spot and died. Idk. I've seen a photo of the guide. Very evil looking, especially the eyes. Perhaps he ran them off the trail, or found them when they were near dying. He found their bones, which is already a red flag. It's funny that they made no goodbye video, no goodbye etching on a tree, no goodbye message typed in phones. Also never took photos of each other after they got lost. The photos would've showed their last conditions. The guide probably knows every inch of the jungle.",

The most disconcerting image to me is the back of the head photo. The hair is absolutely pristine, there is no way if you have been lost in the jungle. Probably just imagining it, but it looks, to me, like a thumb in the bottom right corner as though someone is holding the hair or neck. The photo of the girl with arm behind back looks as though she is intently trying to see in the pitch darkness, the eyes look to be reflecting a flash. I believe this is murder and justice will be done eventually. I understand adventure, but it just isn't safe to go to these places. You are with god now Lisanne and Kris, rest in peace.",

It's even more odd for them to have changed it by making the photo length to make objects appear farther away. If you were going to change it in a survival situation, it would be to bring it in. Making things appear closer for better info. It's almost certain to me that the girls in the \"troubled\" photos are really walking quite spaced apart. Personally, I think they might have because a lone kidnapper was keeping them separated. Standing/threatening one (like with a knife), and making the other stand 10ft forward to make sure that the two couldn't try and both attack you at once to turn the tables.",

They went down the wrong stream thinking they were going down the one they came up and crossed over. They did not go far and most of the horror took place in a small zone because when the sun came up and burned off the mist they would have seen \"the sun is in the wrong place we headed down the wrong way\". The longest stay in one area was near the cutoffs and they put many markers including toilet paper hoping to be found. As they started starving to death and becoming delerious they possibly at night saw the lights of the towns off in the distance and decided that may be an option. the mist comes in in the evening even before dark blocking out views of the sky or into the distance its possible they did NOT see the lights in the distance. The droplets in the photos were not heavy rain they were mist droplets almost like floating rain but they would have likely had rain in those days also. The fatal mistake was going up you are going uphill and following streams also the way down. however when they continued on up onto the divide and flat areas they were doomed. Because now there is almost no way to pick the correct stream and they followed the wrong one scared out of their wits in the dark and clearly took falls. They got lost there were no zombies there were no cartels or cannibals or even other hikers. Why did they not use the phone for days? because they had already tried and once they got down in the wrong ravine they knew full well it would simply use up battery for no reason. why the final attempts? BECAUSE LISA was delerious and doing panicky things expecially if Kris had already been disabled if not dead. Why did Lisa not get code? likely simply because Kris became unexpectedly injured or died and could not give it BEFORE they got to the point \"kris I need that code\". otherwise she would have \n\nthe far locations are not far at all between the items the backpack floated the fastest and furthest and no it would NOT be waterlogged destroying everything in it. that is a myth.

I don't think it's anxiety, in many other photos after the Continental Divide, it is clear that Kris is in a rush and ahead of Lisanne. I think Kris is just annoyed Lisanne is lagging behind (note: sources I've read say that at the time Lisanne had a cold or chest infection at the time).",

I think the photo of the girls hair was an accident by 1 of the culprits.i don't no y but I feel like she is dead in this photo.",

        "text": "You are just repeating what other youtubers have got wrong and their own assumptions, a pretty good investigation was made many years ago by someone who was actually there and had access to all the photos, and talked directly to the police and other private investigators and they came to the conclusion that at one point in the row they took a wrong turn, they got lost, crossed a bridge notorious for being dangerous(locals don't even use it) and got deep into the jungle far away from their route. apparently Kris fell and injured her head, they tried to call for help with Lisanne and Kris phone but they had no signal, the next day Lisanne made several attempts with her phone but couldn't connect, there are pictures of Kris head several actually where you can see blood, apparently Lisanne was trying to see Kris injury in the night with the flash of the camera. Lisanne walked back during the day to try to find signal but came back to Kris during the night. Lisanne phone ran out of battery and she was using Kris phone, she takes a picture of Kris laying on the ground and starts walking back leaving markers, taking photos of them and probably using the flash to walk at night, she arrives to the bridge that she had crossed before but it's been 11 days now and she is weak and falls, some of her belongings are found under the bridge, her remains and other belongings are found several days later downstream from the place she fell. remains of Kris are also found scattered around.\n\nSo ther was no foul play, no murder, it just looks like they got lost, Kris got injured and Lissane didn't want to leave her friend alone, apparently she didn't decide to walk further back the road until Kris died or was completely unconscious and even then she took photos of where she was to find her way back to her, sadly she fell too. Must have been horrible to be lost in the jungle alone and with your friend dying next to you.",

All other brands the deleted pics could be recovered with photo recovery software. If the girls were using one of these two brands, the missing photo would not be a mystery.",

Le corps de son amie ?\nSinon, par rapport aux indigènes \"trop sauvages\" pour savoir effacer une photo, il y a une chose à considérer, ce n'est pas parce que certains vivent en forêt que c'est le cas de tous les membres des tribus, au contraire même, pas mal de jeunes en sortent et vont se \"moderniser\", font des études et reviennent de temps en temps faire un bisou à maman dans la jungle.\nl'esprit tribu est beaucoup plus fort que ce qu'on peut trouver dans nos sociétés actuelles, le cas où un groupe \"sauvage\" aurait pratiqué un rituel \"x\" ou \"y\" avec les filles, puis que l'un des leurs ait voulu restituer le sac pour une raison qui lui appartient, sans pour autant incriminer sa famille, ça colle.\nCette restitution du sac (car c'en est une) peut avoir un message de type \"ne les cherchez plus\", afin peut-être d'apaiser l'esprit des filles (culture animiste).\nPour variante, il existe aussi de nombreux \"civilisés\" qui coexistent, fréquentent les natifs, que ce soit pour des raisons humanitaires ou universitaires, on peut imaginer un anthropologue, désireux à la fois de s'intégrer à la tribu, qui efface la photo pour ne pas les incriminer et dépose le sac en vue sur un lieu de passage pour signifier que les filles ont été dans la zone à un moment et alors c'est une piste.",

La dernière série de photos est certes un peu troublante, l'absence d'une photo dans l'appareil aussi, mais dans quelle affaire où l'accident a finalement été avéré n'y a-t-il pas eu précédemment des éléments qui semblait l'écarter ?

Les flashs de photos s’étaient pour voir leurs chemins ou suite à un bruit ou accident survenu. Les appels d’aide seraient véridique. Ils auraient essayé de rejoindre les communications, mais dans ce coin perdu c’est impossible.

There are simply too many coincidences for the \"Got lost\" theory to be true. \r\nHere are the points that stood out to me and which I still remembered, even years after I read the case:\r\n- The pristine blue backpack. Kris had the backpack when she took selfies at the top of the trail. Assuming the photos are taken on the same day they got lost (there are theories that says otherwise), it is implausible that the backpack could be in a good condition while the girls’ bodies are wrecked. \r\n- The bleached bones and rolled up ball of skin. Anybody who thinks nature did this to the girl’s bodies are delusional. The question is, why a third party would process the girls’ bodies? What is it that they are trying to hide?\r\n- Timing of the “distress calls”. To me they were never distress calls, but a third party tampering with their phones. There was an article analyzing the pattern of the calls and it certainly is not random. It is entirely probable that a third party made the calls while they took breaks at work or while at lunch time.  \r\n- Death of taxi driver that took the girls to the entrance of the trail, and one or two other individual that were related to “The Feliciano guide” (supposedly the last person to see the girls alive). Dead bodies don’t talk. Again, what truth is being hidden here?\r\nOf course all of these could be false for all we know, since we are ultimately relying on other's testimonies. The answer to “Who took the night photos” can be anyone’s guess. There are also all sorts of tampering during the evidence collection process that we could only give the local authorities the benefit of the doubt, since Panama is a developing country. \nBut the bottom line is that it is too superficial for people to be saying that the girls simply “got lost” because the jungle is dangerous (we all know) and that they made calls (who wouldn’t?).",

The girls were severly lacking in their preparation for this hike.  We know they were physically unprepared based on lack of supplies, but this shortcoming also almost certainly sheds light on fact that they were also MENTALLY unprepared and were taking the entire thing too casually (not saying girls weren't mentally strong, just not mentally prepared).  The contents of the backpack were woefully inadequate for even what was intented as a casual excursion.  This is Panama.  You are entering nature's lair, where the \"rules\" change and the fact that they obviously did not duly RESPECT that properly was the foremost problem.\n\n2, Secondly, even with the ill-preparedness and lack of respect for the jungle, they would've been fine just like any other clueless tourist had they simply stayed the course, gone to the peak, made the photos and then immediatley turned back.  But like so many others, it appears that they went off course, perhaps only briefly, for that breathtaking shot of a waterfall or something and couldn't find their way back.  In this sense, ironically, the very adventurous spirt that took them to Panama in the first place was ultimately their undoing.",

The bodies of the girls are covered by the water...which some claim could explain why their bras were in the backpack they found. The boys in this photo died under mysterious circumstances within a year...the same happened the cab driver that drove them to hiking trail. I believe that that there was foul play... maybe the girls were attacked in the river and tried to run...leaving the backpack and clothes behind and they got seriously injured... tried to contact the emergency services but they were found by their attackers, that disposed the bodies and buried them. When the $30.000 reward was offered they skimmed to use the backpack as a way to claim the money while they also unearthed some of the bones and the shoe in order to confuse the authorities... already willing to close the case as an accident. I don't think it was a hiking accident and I don't think that they died in the Pianista Hiking Trail...they were attacked and buried somewhere else in those mountains.",

        "text": "The nightly photos prove nothing. The jungle is full of sounds at night, nature comes alive and sound carries for miles. It is completely dark, a darkness that we no longer know in the West. The sounds around must have terrified them. The flash with the camera must have served to scare off wild animals, just like with an open fire. After all, wild nocturnal animals avoid light. If something around them was moving in the bushes, they might also have been hoping to see what it was in a photo. The question, which potentially deadly predators are living in that area, has never been asked. Panthers? Jaguars? If one of them had a wound or was having her periods, the smell of blood can have been enough to attract one of them. Wounded animals are always the first victims, because vulnerable. Has one of them been bitten by a deadly snake? In the jungle you are lost when that happens. \r\nThe picture of the head was just to see what the (light) wound was. Apparently one of them had hit her head. Nothing unusual on a trip through the jungle between rocks. \r\nWhen someone found the backpack, he may have decided to keep it and its contents. After all, people are very poor there. Later, when rumors started circulating about two missing girls, the finder who had the backpack at his home may have panicked and returned the backpack to where he had found it. \r\nAnd the two bras in the backpack? A trip through the humid and hot jungle can be very unpleasant. Everything sticks to the body. This is probably why the girls during their trip took off their bra and put it away neatly",

Is it difficult for me that we went there alone, two foreign girls, in a jungle? yes ok there is the path, but was it possible there was no one else at that moment? since I don't see other people doing it, I would go back !!! strange then that they didn't make a video if they were injured or lost, nothing. I use the camera to take pictures only at night ?! and why let it be found, together with the phones? for a killer, isn't it better to make it all disappear? then the Photoshop story, the missing photo 509 ... boo, but have you seen where it is? I think he hardly knows or use the phones over there, let alone modify or permanently delete from the pc, some photos ... why then ?? too, too strange everything🙏",

        "text": "I do think this was a tragic accident and that the pictures were purposefully done at night as a last desperate attempt for other people to notice them. They went off the trail, got lost and Kris got seriously hurt by falling or by an animal. From there, Lisanne went to get water and looked for something edible, but not too far to stay close to her friend to tend her wounds or maybe she was too scared an animal would come again and prey on her friend.\nAround 5th april Kris passed away because of the lack of medical attention. Lisanne then put the remaining stuff in the backpack and tried to at least get herself out of there. She wandered around for 3 days, maybe even collapsed and on a last desperate attempt, shot those photos with flashes for someone to notice her. I don't think the deleted photo is too strange, like it was the last one of the daytime ones, she could've just accidently shot it and just deleted it asap. Then it got corrupted and irrecoverable because some of the data was overwritten by the 90 night time photos.\nBut I don't know about the backpack, it should've been somewhere close to Lisanne and I don't think animals would carry it so far with nothing edible being in there.\nIt's just puzzling how and where the bones and the backpack were found, like Lisannes should've been somewhere far off and the backpack with her and not everything spaced out and some bones together and stuff.\n\nRegardless of which theory is correct, it just pains me to see that if the searches at 3rd april had already manage to find them, they both probably would've been saved.",

Big predatory felines are known to live in Panama and they often have a preference for weak or injured prey. I can see how they might have used the flash of the camera to illuminate the area and check the pictures for the shape of a predator or the flash of nocturnal eyes. If the camera had the ability to enhance dark photographs, this would even further explain why they were using it in this way, and taking repeated photos of the same area. If I was convinced that a big cat was stalking me and my injured friend, I would want to make damn sure that noise was NOT something with teeth. Obviously, we can't see anything other than trees and ground and dark sky in the pictures, so maybe the cat was scared off, or maybe it wasn't there to begin with.",

Someone created the pianista trail photos using previous photos from earlier in the season, as you can see lisanne has longer hair and is more tan. I think the last photos are them eating lunch, where lisanne looks disturbed. They were disturbed as they could sense something going on with the school, the guide F., and the taxi driver. They probably doubted the chance they were all involved in a conspiracy, despite what they could sense. Of course they have no idea how much their bodies are truly worth. They were in the crosshairs before they even got to Panama. They should have left when the school would not take them even though they planned months ahead. Its all so sad, I am sure they experienced a shockingly terrifying end. The dutch military should hVe went in",

Then you've got the missing photo in the suspiciously exact spot in the sequence that had to be permanently deleted using a computer and not the camera. On the other hand if they did run into people with bad intentions, why would they allow them to keep their phones to call emergency services on the second day. The area is remote, but not that remote. With at least 8 days to walk youd think they would find another trail that would lead them to some other people or village.

        "text": "I find the format to be a bit disrespectful but to tell the truth it's been 11 years and we still don't have an answer to what happened. I'm happy that someone finally actually went there and recorded all the locations as well as tried to talk to as many people as they could. Staying overnight in that jungle must have been pretty scary and to tell the truth I am not as certain as everyone else seems to be that someone couldn't get lost there under such circumstances. Just a few of my thoughts on the matter; I wouldn't confidently disregard the theory that the girls went missing on the other side of El Mirador simply because one of the villagers said the picture wasn't from that side of the mountain. To be frank, there really isn't any way of him being so familiar with a 14+ hour long trail that he could rule out a specific location with any certainty. I'm guessing the phones were not geo-located since no one knows exactly where the calls were made from, but as the two journalists said, the trail on the Pianista side of the mountain is pretty heavily populated with houses and private properties. Does it seem likely that they were ambushed in an area where people are literally looking at you from their bedroom windows? Also, they started their hike around 11 and were at the mountain summit at 1 pm, so it took them two hours to go uphill; the first emergency call was made at 4:39 PM, so realistically they would have been off the trail by that time (especially since they were going downhill). Second, the little branch on the rock with red material attached to it seems to have part of trail markers that were attached to the branches of a tree. I don't know if there were multiple such markers on the trail or if only one location had them, but if you look up drone footage of the other side of the mountain there is a really tall tree with these little red flags attached to the tops of it's branches near the first monkey bridge on the trail. The bridge itself is different from the one in this video, though the drone footage was shot much later;  it seems to have been updated to be more safe since then and the flow of water was minimal. Looking at the drone footage initially it seemed hard to believe that a fall from this bridge would likely be fatal, especially since the flow of the water was minimal and one could quite easily hop over to the other side from one rock to the next. If this is the same river, however, and the heavy flow is due to it being wet season then it's easy to see how dangerous it would be falling in there.  I disagree with some of the 'experts' that such a fall would certainly be fatal or necessarily resolute in a fractured pelvis or broken neck. That certainly could happen, but it really depends on how they fell in; at what angle and if they had a chance to grab onto something before falling etc. So, finally... what do I think could have happened? This is just a theory but I feel it's plausible given the evidence. The girls thought that the trail looped around the mountain and went down the other side. Maybe they didn't check the map correctly prior to setting out, maybe someone along the way had told them something along these lines/they misunderstood, maybe the trail confused them because it seemed to turn before going down again so they thought they had turned around. Either way, they walked for nearly 4 hours in that direction which is twice what it had taken them to get up. At that point, they were probably fairly certain they had gone the wrong way. This was early April in Panama, so sunset would have been around 6 pm which wouldn't have given them much time before it was dark. I think this is when they panicked and called emergency services, but instead of turning around they kept going forward. I think they didn't make it to the monkey bridge before dark and by the time they did get there they were in enough of a panic to attempt to cross it. Did they fall? Most likely. If they had made it across, chances are they would have finally made the 14 hour long journey towards more populated areas where the villagers and natives lived. I think at least one of them survived, most likely Lisanne, though perhaps both. Lisanne broke her foot from the fall and the water most likely swept both of them down the river. They probably stayed in that area, not too far from this bridge for a while. By April 8th, whoever was taking those photos was by that bridge, in the middle of the night. I'm not quite sure how the search parties wouldn't have come across them unless they didn't search that area until after they were gone. Maybe Lisanne/Kris couldn't get back up out of the river with their injuries and kept going upriver to try to find an easier way up. Maybe their injuries were so severe they couldn't really move from where the river had swept them up. Either way, it's terrifying and still doesn't fully make sense why they weren't found if those night photos on the 8th were taken so close to the monkey bridge which is on the trail.",

It is completely dark, a darkness that we no longer know in the West. The sounds around must have terrified them. The flash with the camera must have served to scare off wild animals, just like with an open fire. After all, wild nocturnal animals avoid light. If something around them was moving in the bushes, they might also have been hoping to see what it was in a photo. The question, which potentially deadly predators are living in that area, has never been asked. Panthers? Jaguars? If one of them had a wound or was having her periods, the smell of blood can have been enough to attract one of them. Wounded animals are always the first victims, because vulnerable. Has one of them been bitten by a deadly snake? In the jungle you are lost when that happens. \n\nThe picture of the head was just to see what the (light) wound was. Apparently one of them had hit her head. Nothing unusual on a trip through the jungle between rocks. \n\nWhen someone found the backpack, he may have decided to keep it and its contents. After all, people are very poor there. Later, when rumors started circulating about two missing girls, the finder who had the backpack at his home may have panicked and returned the backpack to where he had found it. \n\nAnd the two bras in the backpack? A trip through the humid and hot jungle can be very unpleasant. Everything sticks to the body. This is probably why the girls during their trip took off their bra and put it away neatly",

A needle in a haystack.. \n\nHe found the cameras and plastic sunglasses in mint dry clean condition after months in a jungle, not a scratch on the plastic sunglasses or any water danage to electronics. \n\nThe camera had a photo deleted from a computer which state of the art forensic software could not recover. \n\nMy theory. \nHe asked them to go on a tour with them and sleep over at his ranch in the jungle overnight alone with him.\n\nThey refused, which drove his obsession. Many guys cant handle rejection. They were captured on day 1 on the trail,, told to go deeper in the opposite direction to his coffee plantation. He his son and other people raped them, used them as sex slaves. They chopped them up into pieces, They buried the bones in fertilizer from his coffee plantation which bleached the bones. \n\nI discovered that the indiginous there for thousands of years, will chop up the remains of people, strip them of flesh and keep the hair, skull and other bones , in their culture the keeper of the bones inherits the spiritual energy of the deceased, they gain power from the bones and hair. One girls hair was brightly colored so has extra mystical powers in their belief. \n\nOnce lots of search parties involved , he thought his properties could be searched,  ditched the bag which was in mint condition the contents and a couple bones to throw off investigators.\n\nHis multiple properties were never searched by cadaver dogs. \n\nHe was last person to see them alive.\n\nPolice covered it up because it will kill the tourism industry and the third world will become a 4th world country if tourists found it serial killer rapists are there.\n\nThe taxi driver was murdered, and two guys who swam with the girls were murdered.\n\nFinally, the icing on the cake. \nI found a video of the tour guide giving the parents a tour on the pianists trail, guess what's said on camera in their language. \n\n\" is that the gringos parents?\"\n\" yeah\" \n\" dont say anything! \"\n\nWjy would tour guide whisper to the other native \" dont say anything to the gringos parents. Stay quiet!\" While giving a your to look for them.\n5 minutes 18 seconds in. https://youtu.be/cF_9AfrKWKg\n\nOften killers get involved to get close to the investogation and cover their tracks. Involved from day one he also went in their bedroom the next morning after they were kidnapped. \n\nConclusion. \n\nTour guide is killer and other natives there knvolved in cover up.",

The biggest reason that I believe this is because of the condition of the two girl's recovered parts. Especially the roll of skin from Lisanne's shin. That is just the way it would be removed for a skin graft. There is a market in Costa Rica and Panama for this kind of thing. Why wouldn't they take photos of themselves on the second set of photos? It would show that they were still alive. The reason the electronics and other items were recovered, (dry, no less), was because the perpetrators wanted the case to come to a conclusion, showing that no one stole their property, that they died from an \"accident\". This was a trail in, same trail out, and lots of people on the trail, so not like they were isolated. All they had to do was turn around. It seems like the killers worked at the restaurant, at the start of the La Pianista Trail, where they could watch who came and went. When the locals \"found\" the backpack and later remains, this was after the $30k reward was offered, and the locals were unhappy when the parents would not hand over the money to them. The tour guide and his step-son are on the top of the list for being involved. Just some thoughts.",

However, I think the gang involvement is a bit far fetched because why would they take the girls away from the woods for a party and then return their bodies to the woods they took them from? That doesn’t seem likely. If they took them from the woods to a party and killed them, it seems more likely that they would discard their bodies around the town or a completely different area, not simply take them back to the trail. I definitely think one of them got hurt, probably Kris because it’s her bloody hair in one of those photos they took, and the other girl didn’t want to leave her alone and they lost their bearings out in unfamiliar woods and eventually succumbed to the elements.",

Just so police wouldn't be looking for a suspect. But, there were no photos of the faces. Why were no notes made in the phone, such as 'this is what happened to us...' Or even a sound recording of their voices? A frontal video recording? Yes, this would take up battery life, but a 5-second clip would have helped.  If they were alive, they owed that to their families, right??  A final goodbye. All phones have voice recording. The notes facility in the phone or at least one photo of a face would have shown us they were alive at that point. Regarding the hair, allegedly there was some visible blood on the back of the head hair. This is not confirmed but many people have come to this conclusion.",

If you look closely on the right side you can see Lisanne‘s closed eye between the Kris red hair ( often discribed as a cut in Kris skin) and on the bottom right side you see Lisanne’s dark hair. Kris was lying on top of her and both were dead at this time. The poor girls were murdered. Just my opinion.\nThere is a really good video ( search for alternate theories, part 2) which discribes what happened and that the photos and eye witnesses proof that the girls actually came back from the trail in the afternoon and were then picked up and abducted. It‘s by far the most  plausible scenario I have heard off.",

Just leaning against the camo bag-looking thing. \nI will always believe they were kidnapped by rebels or some nefarious man. He kept items for survival and placed non-important items back into the one backpack. Almost like an apology but to cause the search for where to find the remains.

        "text": "Something I've spoken about before with you Scarlet is the time factor of reaching that Stream location and the uncertainties of following a 'Loop' trail that might lead back to Boquete. But I just recently noted you point out on your blog that the Pianista trail here is entered \"...about nine kilometers north of the Spanish language school and their host family's house.\"\n\n9 km equals around 5 or so miles - a very considerable distance. They had checked Googlemaps at 10.10 that morning, almost certainly checking how to access the trail and how to get there, and so makes complete sense out of the need for the Taxi. But I imagine the ride to the Resteraunt at the head of the trail would take around 15 minutes, depending on traffic, and on foot might take a good two hours if walking. Again, depending on speed on the day.\n\nSo with this in mind it does add more weight to my suspicion that by the time they reached that stream they would have been very aware of the need to be turning back - two and a half hours to get to this point, and another two and a half hours to return to the resteraunt, would mean around 4.30pm. And then they would need to find a taxi or bus to get back home....\n\nThey knew the time as they had used their phones on the summit, so when you think on all of this it beggars belief that they would have walked on and on after the stream, as they had no idea where this path led out to, and certainly no idea if it would have transport a the end of it!\n\nI am quite convinced that the reason the photography stopped at the stream is because they knew all this, and this was as far as they would go. They were preparing to return to the summit. But something obviously went wrong at this point...",

Why would they have walked so far off the trail? without proper supplies, knowledge or clothing. Why were only a handful of the cameras photos released to the press? Why the deleted image 509? Why no larger remains found? no skulls? no other clothing? How was the backpack in such good condition and dry after allegedly being washed down the river? How were the phones as such..and the camera also in dry working condition? Why did neither of them attempt to record any video in daylight or to record sound on either the camera or their phones? I would deduce it was because their phones and the camera were in the hands of their abductors the whole time. The night photos were taken simply to throw off the investigation. Why would the girls remove their bras and place them in the backpack? Why only a single water bottle? In my mind I have no doubt they met with terrifying and brutal deaths at the hands of some cruel local or a group of locals and were lured or forced off the trail then who knows what those poor girls went through before they died. The whole case stinks of a typical South American corrupt country covering its own ass. I hope they rest in peace and I hope the 2 families find inner peace one day too!",

So my guess is they used their flash of the camera to see something at night. Also, they could have just gone downhill. This mountain is more or less surrounded by nearby villages. Maybe they wanted to stay there for the night, because it was too dark to see anything. And while staying there they got attacked. Probably the two of them miscalculated the time they would need to get back to their village, eventually got lost, had an accident or got attacked. Still this doesn't explain why their body parts were scattered across the whole area or that their backpack was found days later even though they had already looked for them there earlier at the same places.",

Il est vrai que si ces deux jeunes femmes ont perdu la vie suite à un meurtre, cela aurait été plus intelligent de la part du ou des meurtrier(s) de détruire l’appareil photo et de le jeter dans l’eau. Ce que je trouve très étrange par contre c’est pourquoi personne n’a pu apercevoir les deux femmes et pourquoi les ossements d’une des deux femmes n’a jamais été retrouvé au complet. Bref…c’est une histoire à en devenir fou, vraiment.\nContinue comme ça tu es excellente 🩷",

The other one is far away and ahead because they're scouting a route for the injured girl to take while the other hobbled along behind. \n\nEventually the pain is too much or shock sets in due to the injury and weather/wet (cold and wet overnight or from river may be hypothermia), and the one holding the camera passes out, begins going semi conscious, or dies. \n\nThe other girl brings the body or helps the possibly semi conscious one walk. Cellphone dies, so tries to unlock other friends phone. Continues to try calling emergency services. \n\n7 days of all night use a flashlights batteries will die. The camera is then used to navigate using flash as the second girl continues to try to escape. This kills the battery on the camera. Unclear if she left the body of the other girl or not. The back of the head photo leads me to think she was alone and was checking for an injury back there by taking the picture. Hair is relatively clean after 7 days, especially if it gets wet. \n\nFinal girl losing consciousness and stumbles off a bridge or slips from a rock, breaking herself and drowning.  Backpack and shorts wash up immediately, shorts either came off in the flowing river due to weightloss pass 8 days or scavengers. Digital camera was found by woman. Probably poor woman who kept it for a while for herself, which is why she had it. Free back pack full of free stuff, probably just stole it, until she saw about the missing girls on TV. At which point she turned it in. Simple petty theft of unclaimed item in the woods. Digital camera will definitely work if it was turned off and battery was dead when it got wet, then dried completely before being turned on, which is likely. \n\nGirls are dead. The innumerable ways a body decomposes in the wild and the bugs weather etc present too many variables. We will never know why all of the bones were found the way they were. Fish and water especially can clean a bone. Scavengers and birds particularly will carry bones great distances, hence the spread. However, if sealed in a boot, tightly laced, and leather, will keep predators out. Surprisingly a lot of animals won't fight to get meat out of boots due to smell and taste of the leather. Which is what hiking boots are made of. If the laces are tight they will eat to the ridge and leave the rest, giving the impression of a clean cut. \n\n We all saw the avg monthly payment of people there. That tour guide cared because he wanted the money for the tour. He may have tried to steal some money to make up for the loss of the tour when visiting the girls room, explaining the 30 min in there. But nothing was taken anyway. Then there is a reward worth more than several months of work, of course he's scouring the woods. He knows them like the back of his hand. He's fairly confident he can find them and get the money. Which he does. \n\nAll of this is in light detail I don't want to type it all and rife with grammatical and spelling errors sorry. Again I'm not saying it's not foul play; But an accident, naivety, greed, and more innocent petty crimes could be the issue.",

They continued past the Mirador but realized they couldn't make it back before nightfall and that's when they got scared and called 112 on April 1 but they encountered someone on the trail that lured them back to his place, with evil intent but made them felt at ease at first, being naive and trusting girls needing help, and were relieved initially. Then they were held captive and Kris was killed first on the 8th before the night photos were taken, Lisanne later given how her skin was found four months later still in early decomposition. My take: That's how there was no sense of panic the first night, no frantic emergency calls the first night, how Kris' hair looked so clean despite being in a jungle for a week which they were never, no sign of the backpack being in the jungle which it was never until it was planted, how they disappeared from the Pianista trail that was traveled and said to be impossible to get lost on with no sign of a struggle. Photo 509 could be a picture taken of the captor once they realized they were in danger, that he or they erased later on a home computer after seizing it, and then later took the night pictures, staging it to make it look like they were lost, but was actually disposing of a body. Some bones and the backpack was planted as false evidence.",

        "text": "I feel like there are straightforward answers to most of these questions: Almost all of the remains and items look like they're close to the river, so the simple and logical explanation is that they floated downriver or were carried there by scavenging animals. The backpack (if it didn't float down) could have been found upriver and then taken by someone who later realised its importance and dropped it, which would also explain the fingerprints, although they could have come from just about anyone at any time. And it's no wonder two young girls didn't want to take photographs of each other when they were both lost, tired, hungry, etc. The rates of decomposition may have related to relative time of death or where the bodies initially decomposed (in soil, water, the sun, etc.)",

        "text": "I've heard and read several versions of this story. Including a few Dutch documentaries and reports.\nI believe your representation of the facts here is rather subjective. You have made assumptions, or have copied other peoples assumptions. You also implied that the Dutch research team has a different conclusion than the panama research team, and while they kept the investigation open for longer, they reached the same conclusion in the end.\n\nYou have left out a few crucial details about the case, including their attempts at making an sos message using toilet paper, including leaving a mirror to hopefully attract attention. Implying that they were trying to be found. And implying that they tried to stay put, waiting for rescue.\n\nA few things to note: \nThe search was relatively large for the country, but the area that had to be searched was a thick jungle. Also, the search was also not well structured. The area where the girls most likely were located, and stayed put in, was only touched on 2 weeks into the search. The bones were not as weirdly scattered as you make it out to be, as especially scavengers tend to spread remains over an area. The foot is an easy example of this. New forensic research that has only recently concluded has confirmed that there are no traces on the bones that imply human interaction with them. The \"bleached\" bone is more accurately described as most likely sunbleached. There is little more to it.\nThe missing photograph was deleted, but it is entirely possible that it was deleted by the girls using the camera. There is no evidence of it being done differently. Although it is entirely possible that the photo was deleted later by someone else.\n\nIt's a sad story. But everything points to girls getting lost in an immense jungle. Sadly losing their life to the wilderness.",

That is, they didn't realise it was an out and back trail.  \nThey were ill prepared for the conditions, unfamiliar with the trail, inexperienced hikers, and instead of being able to self rescue they made further errors and possibly became injured.  \nThe location that the backpack was found makes sense if they continued in the wrong direction and reached the cable bridge.  There was more damage to the backpack than what many channels make out.  \nDisarticulation of joints is also not unusual in deaths in water.  \nEven the other bones, if they were there, would not be unusual considering that locals have fallen from the bridge, or been swept away in flooding, but do not have the resources for such a large scale search.  \nThe camera I believe was dropped, or damaged with water, hence the malfunction and missing photo.",

Based on Kris's body posture the last photo I think they were going a little bit farther though.  Maybe to try and discover if one of the waterfalls was close by?  I have a suspicion that shortly after that before the next stream about 20 minutes down trail they got off trail for some reason and got lost. The Dad is right in that the stream would have been the next logical picture area for the girls or the area about ten minutes after that was scenic.  Maybe they went off trail because they thought they heard a waterfall? Or even as simple as went a bit off trail to go to the bathroom and got turned around somehow.  If you follow lost hiker stories on You Tube examples like that happen.  You get ten feet off a trail and turn around and you can't even see it.  I'm in the minority in that I believe they got lost and then at some point injured and it spiraled down from there and they eventually died close to or in the river.",

One thing that people don’t always understand is that Panama doesn’t have the resources to begin searches and if they had been state side they would of been found sooo quick. One survived I think it was 11 days but no one knows which one.\nIt’s one strange strange case. And it’s been years and we still don’t have any resolution.\nThe trail they went on was one mile and super touristy. It was an easy trail. The problem was - from the photos it’s clear they went beyond the trail. If only they had stopped and turned around but they continued to explore ( who wouldn’t ? ) and the biggest thing is it’s so easy to immediately get lot and turned around once you get off a trail. Also - the snake river they tried to follow ( they say follow the river and you will find people ) is just the opposite of normal rivers in that following it would not of resulted in them finding people but just the opposite it was taking them further away. But I haven’t even listened to your work on it yet so I will shut up and see what y’all say and then jump back in :) \nAlso I don’t think they were best friends - they actually met at worked and barely knew each other but they did get along real well.",

Mainly because of the time line and the reports of many witnesses in Boquete. They took their last April 1  photo at just before 14.00 hours. They still had more than four hours daylight in which to get back down to the village and many people confirmed having seen them there at about 15.00- 15.30 hours. The trail is a 4 km there-and-back trip and would take about three to four hours. They went a little further than the Mirador but they could still easily have got back within a couple of hours. Also the path is deeply engraved and veering from it requires a considerable and deliberate effort, as said by the mother of Kris. You'd have to really want to get lost.  \nHaving said that,  the night photos make it difficult to believe that they were not lost at the time when these were taken but this was one whole week after the girls had set out on the Pianista Trail. It's quite bizarre.",

That also would explain why they make no sense and seem so random. It is also highly likely that they used the flash when it was absolutely needed, in order to avoid some dangerous situations (cliffs, unclear and steep pathing, weird /scary noises or silhouettes). I am also convinced that at some point they saw or heard someone and took a pic to see who that was, catching that person or people on film. That someone would kill them and delete permanently the last photo taken because it would have captured the killer himself.",

        "text": "The people who make the assumption that it was not a crime - because of the subsequent pictures in which Kris looks well (though not as exuberant as before),  are men. No man has ever been in a position where he trusted someone - who suddenly turns out to be very bad - blames you for having \"led him on\" and you're trapped - he's bigger and stronger than you, and in this case, he is the one who can lead you back to safety. So you have to play along, Stockholm Syndrome style - pretend everything is fine. He knows you know it isn't, and he's enjoying your powerlessness that you have to pretend everything is OK, when he knows that you know your life is in his terrible hands. That is why they still had access to their useless phones for almost a week, but no more happy snaps.\nThey were so happy to reach the summit. Took some selfies, and now you can turn back. Then a \"fellow-hiker\" appeared, telling them there is a waterfall not far from here, where you can cool off and fill your waterbottles before you start the return journey. So far so normal. Perfectly common occurrence between hikers meeting at the summit.\nThe stranger (or maybe they had met before in the village) saw that Kris was doubtful, probably had a gut instinct there is something not right about this guy. Thus he walked with Lisanne, chatting with her, so that Kris couldn't \"infect\" Lisanne with her doubts. Kris was several metres ahead, as the last photos showed. When she turned back her smiles were reluctant, not a broad grin like before. Kris's cross-legged stance in one of the last pictures shows that she is actually quite pissed off with Lisanne - like crossing your arms.\nWhen they reached the waterfall, Kris will have felt reassured that this guy was legitimately only trying to be friendly and helpful and that her unease had been unfair. So they took off their clothes, put their belongings neatly in the backpack and stood under the waterfall to cool off. Soon after that came the terrible realization that their trust had been misplaced.\nMen would fight back right away, but women know (a) they are out-muscled, (b) they need this guy to lead them out of the jungle. He has the advantage over them and they have to play along, pretend everything is OK, no matter what he did to them. But at some stage they realised he would not allow them to get back alive and lay criminal charges. They realised he would not let them get out of there alive. That's when they tried to escape, in the middle of the night, while they could hear him snoring. Of course they could not outrun or outsmart this guy in the jungle that he knows so well.",

        "text": "The nightly photos prove nothing. The jungle is full of sounds at night, nature comes alive and sound carries for miles. It is completely dark, a darkness that we no longer know in the West. The sounds around must have terrified them. The flash with the camera must have served to scare off wild animals, just like with an open fire. After all, wild nocturnal animals avoid light. If something around them was moving in the bushes, they might also have been hoping to see what it was in a photo. The question, which potentially deadly predators are living in that area, has never been asked. Panthers? Jaguars? If one of them had a wound or was having her periods, the smell of blood can have been enough to attract one of them. Wounded animals are always the first victims, because vulnerable. Has one of them been bitten by a deadly snake? In the jungle you are lost when that happens. \n\nThe picture of the head was just to see what the (light) wound was. Apparently one of them had hit her head. Nothing unusual on a trip through the jungle between rocks. \n\nWhen someone found the backpack, he may have decided to keep it and its contents. After all, people are very poor there. Later, when rumors started circulating about two missing girls, the finder who had the backpack at his home may have panicked and returned the backpack to where he had found it. \n\nAnd the two bras in the backpack? A trip through the humid and hot jungle can be very unpleasant. Everything sticks to the body. This is probably why the girls during their trip took off their bra and put it away neatly",

Suggest a Emergency signal for search teams, possibly for a helicopter or something like that.\nSo that means they were alive, at least one of them, and maybe lost or in trouble, one of them wounded or something.\n\nAlso the many \"blank\" photo's were maybe just for the use of the flashlight. So this also indicates they were still alive for some time, but in some kind of trouble, lost and in the dark. \nProbably in this case. They just got lost and maybe one or even both of them fell of a rock or slipped into the river or whatever, wounded.\nBeing in the jungle inexperienced is of course dangerous and can very easy and quickly turn into a life threatening situation. Even for an experienced person with enough equipment.\n\nThe fact that personal belongings were found including money and ID cards. Makes a (normal) crime less probable. \nAll the \"witnesses\". Well often witnesses are not very reliable. Everywhere in the world but probably specially in relatively poor countries. For a small amount of money or a big amount people will say anything. Or maybe just be accidentally wrong on something. \n\nAll by all, yes ufo's or aliens is always a possibility, in any situation. But i don't see this in this case. The simple logical explanation of maybe an accident and getting lost, is much more probable i think.\nFollowed this case before. I am also from the Netherlands. But still i picked up things in this video that i didn't knew, hear or saw before. So compliments for that.",

In first place, it´s incredible that, after that first afternoon when they first called for help, the girls didn´t do more photos or videos of the landscape or themseves (no battery problem with the camera) in all those days they were supposed to be wandering lost in the jungle. And it´s also very strange that their remains were so few, destroyed, and scattered, whereas their backpack, bras, phones and camera were found intact in a place a local woman said she didn´t see anything days before. That backpack seems staged months later to be found. I think this case was rape and murder and the unusually devious murderers used the staged backpack, absurd and dark photos, few body remains, and unsuccessful emergency calls to convince police that the girls got lost and had an accident.",

This argument is used a lot, but most notably when it comes to seeing the girls. Logic 101.\n\n2) \"the bones show no damage\", but in the next senctence they're 'destroyed' and 'bleached', this clearly is damage. The jungle has a huge amount of different sub-environments, some of them easily could be alkaline which can speed up bleaching. Also, there are other animals than predators in the forest that will eat human tissue...\n\n3) You can't say anything about the photo's since you don't have the originals. We have to take them at face value until they conflict with other HARD evidence. Not flimsy witness statements (the weakest evidence there is)\n\n4) The Pianista Puzzle has shown  to the verge of certainty that the girls made the picture. They used a 3d reconstruction. Look it up. These 2 goofballs are just speculation without ANY evidence.\n\n5) \"I don't build my own idea\", yes, yes you clearly do. You think things are not likely, therefore you don't believe them.\n\n6) After 8 days in the jungle you can't say anything about the mental state of the girls. If you don't think the photo's are logical, that's exactly what you expect. \n\n7) on picture 509. The picture was called 'deleted' by the NFI because  there was a picture 508 and 510 and there was root data on 509. It seemed deleted. However, it could very well be that the picture was never made but this was a malfunction. It could very well be moment of the accident: falling and water disconnecting the battery. This would also explain why the camera was off for 8 days;  it got wet and they didn't want to turn it on.\n\n8) phone calls. Again, their argument is: \" I can't imagine\". This is not evidence. You don't know the mental state nor were they were. \nAlso: it's not about what experts think.... It' s about what the girls thought at that moment. \n\n9) \"what you expect\". My god.... really? \n\n10) thumbs up? Really? Is this your 'evidence'? You are claiming the involvement of someone based on one of the most universal hand gestures in the world. \nYou don't want to cast suspicion yet that exactly what you do.\n\n11) You can't IMAGINE lost or accident can't be without foul play aka tunnel vision.\n\nEdit: removed some spelling errors. Typing on a phone is harder than one might expect :)",

That with what seems to be grass on the nearest edge that go out from the camera's view seems to heavily suggest this. The dark spot on the right side of the rock face is also too spread out to suggest that it's a puddle and is more likely a trickle of water which may have been clean enough to drink for natives who could worry less about local disease from the soil. There's also a tiny sapling of sorts growing on the rock face on the left about halfway up the frame with 6 distinguishable leaves growing at a 45 degree angle and the side of the leaf we can see is notably dull meaning that its growing out and facing away from the camera's view. That sort of suggests that the vegetation is so dense around this potential cliff side that the sapling prefers growing its leaves to face upward as if it isn't getting quite enough sun from the area across from the cliff face. It would likely face its leaves in the direction of its current growth if it received unimpeded sunlight from over there. It's such a silty cliff face. I wonder if it receives a lot of rain and the runoff carries a lot of soil with it which gets caught on the side.\n\nI wonder, in an early photo, there's stones and exposed roots along what seems to be a stream, maybe that trickle off the cliff face was the start of that river. It's a thing in survival tips that if you're totally lost and you've found a stream, its worth a shot to follow the stream as towns are usually founded on the sides of water sources. The thing is that you're supposed to follow them downstream, not up, and they may have misremembered and went up or they thought it didn't matter which way.",

Lisanne panicked and scrambled down the treacherous embankment where she was also injured, maybe twisting an ankle or breaking a leg. Lisanne was unable to hike out to get help, and unwilling to leave here severely injured friend. Kris succumbed to her head injury and Lisanne died later, maybe from exhaustion, dehydration, or snake bite. the many photos in the night may have been attempts to signal for help or ward off wild animals.",

Pour moi ce n'est pas le visage de kris mais plutôt le visage d'un singe. Peut être que pendant la nuit, elles se soient fait alpaguées par un singe (+- agressif) et qu'elles ont voulu ou immortaliser l'instant (dans leur malheur si elles avaient survécue ca aurait été un chouette moment, ou parce qu'elles se sont fait attaqué mais dans le noir, difficile de se défendre donc petite photo/flash pour se défendre) je trouve ca logique surtout si on part du principe qu'elles ont fait un chute et qu'elles sont restées au même endroit jusqu'à leur mort",

I do wonder whether it still has that touch of unreality about it for them, with so many key questions left unaddressed and unanswered can there be any real closure?\n--------------------------------\n\n\"..Behind a Tree Trunk, almost Under it,\"\n\nYou read that description, and see the photograph of the finders stood over it, and ask the obvious question - how does this boot(and its foot) get from a supposed journey down the river to being in this strange and unlikely position? Behind and almost under a tree trunk on the riverside somewhere, you might argue some animal carried it there, but is it coincidence that the tree trunk is an easily identifiable feature and would work to protect and hide the boot until a search party coming down the river thinks to walk over to this unremarkable tree trunk (or log) and inspect it.\nPerhaps I can read too much into its lucky find here, but then when Hans Kremer's independently points out the strangeness of his daughters fastened shorts found while her hip-bone is found kilometres downstream you do have corroboration of your queries here. Kremers himself is clearly an astute man, very perceptive and was able to spot some of the odd elements to the findings early on.\n\nBut as i just happened to read a new entry on your blogs first page you print out an autopsy report on the few found remains which reveals the pathologists results of their inspection. \nAnd the report from them that Lisanne's few remains (leg bone) showed the signs of  \"Root\" bleaching from almost certainly being buried in a shallow grave is stunning if true, and I have no  reason to think it isn't if this report is genuine. But why is it that no one picked up on this detail in the report...? It turns the story upside down, was it suppressed perhaps, or is the case that no one picked up on this up until now? And is this result from the bone found in June, or the ones found in late August ...?",

Ans: kidnapping/abducttion and chopped, my aunt used to work on this area as a park rescuer for this type of cases and I can assure you it was murdered and some tipe of cannibalism, I used to remember to this day the face he made when speaking of those tribes that sometimes they mentioned to eat lost tourists, the lost photo probably was deleted by the killer and the photo of Kris hair is just tell me that they were someone else. To us panamanians those jungle trips are just stupid DONT go alone dummy even when I used to go hunting with my aunt with a springfield hunting rifle a machete a compass, water filters and food. This jungles are imposible to watch someone from a chopper it must be done by foot and patrol those areas. Its just too dense and dangerous of a jungle",

His remains did not provide any clues so they just ruled his COD as \"exposure\".  And Mr Sands was an experienced hiker.  \nI live in Australia and hiking at night... depends on where you are, but you must always stick to the trail!  And seasoned hikers camp at night, even in \"safe\" locations.  And then you have other countries that have bears and big cats.  I'm a lot more scared of bears and big cats than anything in Australia, including sharks.",

One theory that I think is kind of possible is that someone scared them off the trail. Like maybe somebody was following too close so they veered off to get away from them. Or even worse, someone could have ordered them to leave the trail. This person could have done whatever they wanted to do and then just leave the girls in the middle of the jungle to fend for themselves. I totally can see some weirdo seeing two young beautiful girls by themselves hiking and thinking it was a great time to take  advantage. The night photos are super creepy. Especially the one of Kris Kremers head. Gives me chills whenever I see it. Something tragic happened. I wish we were able to get more information but unfortunately I think we have all we’re ever going to get for this case.",

FACT is both the local youths are also dead - one dying on 4 April 2014 and the other died in 2015. The SPECULATION is that the women actually made it out of the trail (could they have gone on 31 March, not 1 April?), possibly followed people to the Caldera and perhaps were later abducted there. The two youth were involved somehow, were the most squirmish in the abduction gang and had to be silenced. A websleuth has pointed to many similarities in some rock formations seen in the 90 night photos and certain rock formations in the Caldera.",

Somewhere along they encounter someone odd or at least two people because they were tall girls, so it had to be at least 2 or more people there..Lisanne herself was 1.84m tall and central americans are known to be very small.  Anyway the girls are uneasy.  Something happens and they begin to run...they call 112, 911..no luck.  They are captured, taken away and raped/tortured.  The police are on a frantic hunt for the girls which frightens the capturers.  So they send the girls back out half alive days later to die in the jungle.  One girl then attempts at drawing attention by taking pictures (this still confuses me as to why they wouldnt photograph themselves) but judging by the photo of Kris I believe she is dead at this point.  Now either Lisanne is trying to get into Kris' phone at this point or the capturers were trying to see what evidence was on there.  One or the other.\n\nThe capturers then realize the girls have too much evidence on them perhaps sperm finger prints etc.  So they take them back and dispose of the bodies perhaps profiting off their organs.  \n\nThey then plant bones here and there in the jungle to draw attention toward the lost in jungle theory.  They plant the backpack there as well so that they do not hold on to any evidence.",

I don't research on this case for my criminal justice class and #508 was the last happy picture of the girls the day before the hike then #509 was deleted and #510 started the series of night time pictures. Not just the fact that the girls had several blurry photos together before the hike that they never deleted but the picture was deleted beyond recovery which requires a laptop otherwise it would have still been accessible to a recovery team. Foul play is definitely a factor in this. Especially since after days they had to have come to the conclusion that they were going to die and they never left even a goodbye picture or video for their families. I will always be fascinated by this case. It's what sparked my love for criminal justice. I just wish we could know what truly happened though that is something that will never happen.",

He would have been able to collect the girls belongings when he helped look in their apartment initially.

BUT, PERSONALLY, I do believe that it was just an accident that the corrupt AND INCOMPETENT authorities managed SO BAD that in the end... the case just doesn't make sense. For example, I heard that one of the photos WAS in fact altered by authorities but it was an accident, they didn't save the original first and they brightened a photo to see better... altering the evidence. An in that way, they could have bleached the bone and then they were like \"shoot, forgot to take the picture first\". \n\nWe cannot believe in any evidence. \n\nSo, yeah, I think it was incompetence, corruption and (without a doubt) a sense of rush to close the case.",

It goes either north or south. So there must have been a very good reason for the girls to keep going farther into the jungle and I think you gave us the most plaussible theory. The tour guide followed them. The \"they fell into the water story\" just doesn't add up. I mean, why did they both try and call the emergency number just 3 hours after reaching the summit and the next day (14 hours later) at least Kris in the pictures seems not to be injured. I really think this case should be reopend and the tour guide properly researched as the main suspect. He just pops into the story too many times, finding the shoe, bones etc. He may even took the girls to his coffee plantation and locked them up and raped them for a few days when they eventually tried to escape during the night on the 11th and got killed in the proces. I just hope new evidence will be found one day, although it is near impossible after so many years. Just wanted to thank you for this very detailed and realistic view of this case. I can tell you it was very scary to watch, especially what you told us about the change in atmosphere in the later photos. I think what these girls must have been gone through is worse than hell and I can't stop thinking about it. Just scares the hell out of me every time.",

I was lucky to be only two km from my house and got knew the area in last few weeks since I started to live there. I can see that 90 photos were taken in panic about the sounds in the jungle. I mean I got scared not knowing what were the sounds I was hearing in Sweden, I wouldnt want to hear a jungle in the night. Especially if I think there are people around me.",

Plus the theory that they actually returned and met with those local boys and they killed them is making way more sense than it should. Photos with the boys later from that day from which you cant tell that it is them 100% but everything from hair color, skin color (they were obviously very white compared to the local population), to their heights (Froon was 184cm tall and the girl in the picture was really tall...tell me how many 180+ cm tall women live in Panama? 3?) and shape of bodies and even shape of their faces ...everything matches, and the fact that two of the boys died mysteriously soon after the girls disappeared....This is one of my favorite true crime mysteries. I am always skeptical when it comes to wild theories but I don't think I have ever come across one that would make more sense (maybe 9/11 lol)",

J'ai toujours été convaincu, et je le suis toujours, que l'identification de l'endroit exact où les \"photos nocturnes\" ont été prises serait très utile : si l'endroit est proche de la zone où les restes des filles ont été retrouvés, alors tout ferait penser vraiment à un accident. Au contraire, si l'endroit est très éloigné, alors le soupçon que les restes ont été emmenés ailleurs serait très fort, et cela nous suggérerait un crime. Honnêtement, je ne suis pas du tout convaincu qu'un câble d'un pont de singe soit immortalisé sur une des photos nocturnes...",

So i guess they thought it would be a circular path. Otherwise it wouldn't made any sense to go deeper and deeper in the jungle because they hadn't enough time to get back before it got dark.\n\nThey called at approx 5 pm the emergency call, most likely not because they had an accident already i guess, but at that time they noticed they are definitly completly lost and the dark will set in soon. I think a probably accident then happend in the night or the next day.\n\nWhat are you guys thoughts about that?",

        "text": "Those narratives that say that girls could be very bad, from a physical and psychological point of view, to make conscious use of both the camera and the phones, practically fell apart with this schematic drawing at the beginning of your video. Someone made most of the calls within the same hour span, regardless of whether it was the girls or a third party making the calls, the fact is: There was a lot of situational awareness, discipline and intentionality in cell phone use, even on the 11th! About three days after the night shots.\n\nNote: Well observed! If Dutch women turned off their cell phones after using them, how could they make calls within the same hourly range the next day? Because there is no way to look at the time on the cell phone, because it is turned off. In one of these opportunities, the person got the same minute right and in three other opportunities he got the time wrong by only two or three minutes. There are only two alternatives left: 1- Did K&L use the camera's time as a reference? 2- Was a third party based on your own cell phone or a wristwatch?\n\nNote: It makes no sense for them to use the sun as a reference, knowing that in those mountains the clouds can block the sunlight for a long time. It would be too much of a coincidence if the sun was not obstructed by clouds within exactly the same hour interval, for five days in a row and ten times in those eleven observed days. Just look at the photos taken at the top of the viewpoint, in a matter of minutes in the same hour interval, the sky went from sunny to cloudy (believing that there was no major tampering with the time of the photos).\n\n\nEssas narrativas que dizem que as garotas podiam está muito mal, do ponto de vista físico e psicológico, para fazerem um uso consciente tanto da câmera como dos telefones, praticamente caiu por terra com esse desenho esquemático do início do seu vídeo. Alguém fez a maioria das ligações dentro do mesmo intervalo de hora, independente de ter sido as garotas ou um terceiro fazendo as ligações, o fato é: Havia muita consciência situacional, disciplina e intencionalidade no uso dos celulares, até mesmo no dia 11! Cerca de três dias após as fotos noturnas.\n\nObs: Bem observado! Se as holandesas desligavam os celulares após o uso, como conseguiam fazer as ligações dentro do mesmo intervalo de hora no dia seguinte? Pois não têm como olhar o horário no celular, pois ele está desligado. Em uma dessas oportunidades, a pessoa acertou até o mesmo minuto e em outras três oportunidades errou o horário apenas por dois ou três minutos. Só resta duas alternativas: 1- K&L utilizaram o horário da câmera como referencial? 2- Um terceiro se baseou em seu próprio celular ou em um relógio de pulso?\n\nObs: Não faz sentido elas utilizarem o sol como referencial, sabendo que naquelas montanhas as nuvens podem bloquear a luz do sol por um bom tempo. Seria muita coincidência que o sol não sofresse obstrução das nuvens exatamente dentro do mesmo intervalo de hora, por cinco dias seguidos e por dez vezes nesses onze dias observados. Basta ver as fotos tiradas no topo do mirador, em questão de minutos no mesmo intervalo de hora, o céu foi de ensolarado para nublado(acreditando que não houve uma grande adulteração do horário das fotos).",

When there was too much excitement, Feliciano took a few bones out of the grave and distributed them. I think it was his son and his \"gang\"! And they died on the very first day! Feliciano took the night photos and dialed 911! The night photos are all the same, in the same place! And the \"back of the head\" of Kris ..... she was already dead! This is the severed head from her! The hair looks like it has just been washed, that was 100% on day one! Died by day one!!!",

If they got lost they could just simply turned back, cause sounded like it was one way in and out, 3. The fact they called first couple of 211 at 4:30pm in daylight, why?? They both injured couldn’t go back? If that was the case they would stay where they were and they’d be found cause I don’t think within 3 hours they could walk too deep into the jungle. They still could see their way back… also they could use their phone to record things and say something esp one of them wrote diary, also why those photos later they took didn’t show any of them?! If they were injured and alive they could take some photos of themselves whether their foot was broken … so based on just all these I think they were held against their wills and were hidden somewhere so the rescue groups couldn’t find them…😢 also the local police deleted the 509 picture because two girls probably took a picture of someone in it",

If they were scared, why they did not take those photos at first night? Why they called to 112 or 911 only once on first day. I think that most people call many times just when something happen, even if there is not signal. It´s possible that some moment there can find signal. And why they where in silence so many days. I believe that they lost they lives at the first days. After that someone else used camera and phones just for play that girls are still alive and lost in to jungle. I have a strong feeling that local boys followed them and situation went bad for girls. Maybe the boys got some advice from Mr F.",

I believe the body parts were planted at the locations where they were found to provide evidence for the fake story on how and where they died....it`s a cover-up to hide the truth.",

        "text": "Personally I think the girls’ intent was to go on a mild hike and to make some memories. That was why they chose their attire (underwire bras, denim shorts etc.) the type of clothing you might want to take photos in. They were totally clueless about the trail and probably thought it was a loop that would bring them back to their starting point. That coupled with the fact that there were houses along the way etc probably made them feel overconfident. I could see them telling themselves “just a little further and the trail will bring us back around”. Eventually they realized this was not the case, tried to contact emergency services and more than likely turned around. I agree with Josh that they were smart about the way they chose to call and conserve battery. It also shows that they were in a calm state of mind and most likely not injured. I think they probably held out hope for a long time and only started feeling truly desperate during the night photos. I agree with Kendall that it was definitely an attempt to signal. \nThe most confusing aspect is how were they not found with all the efforts and the area??? And I think that is why people come up with hairbrained theories. However if you’ve looked into the Missing 411 phenomena its not uncommon for searchers to not find any clues.",

        "text": "Recently here in the US an 18 year old girl ran out of gas and decided to go into the woods to find a nearby bridge (something like that).  She quickly got lost and was found 8 days later.  They stated she was delirious and completely out of her mind, so to speak.  She was so confused at the hospital that she thought she had been gone for only three days, when it was 8 (she also didn't make any type of goodbye video either).  Although rugged terrain, she was in a much more forgiving environment than a jungle.  In the West, when someone goes missing, there is an Army of available services.  Satellites, Blackhawk helicopters, those 100k dollar Norwegian tracking dogs, etc.  In a small, poor nation like Panama with its tiny GDP, you have very little other than the kindness and duty of the locals.  She was also found only 1 mile away from where her car was parked.  \n\nThis story in a word, sucks.  There are questions that will never be answered and there will always be doubt.  But nearly all experts agree, regardless of the strange circumstances, that the most probable reality is the crappiest one.  They simply died from a combined factor of exposure, hunger, mental breakdown, and possibly injury.  I myself am very surprised they will able to live so long there.  Their fitness and spirit kept them alive for at least 8 days and at least one survived for about 11.  The nighttime cold must have been unbearable.  The temperatures got as low as the 50s.  If you don't think thats cold then set your house temperature to 53 degrees, take a shower and walk around your home, you will be freezing.  Heartbreaking they didn't have so much as a poncho to bundle up in.  I've seen many people play private Detective and I guess they are well meaning.  Some people like to think they are smarter than everyone else and know better.  However, saying things like a killer uploaded the photos and then put them back in original form and photoshopped one of the girls breasts to look bigger is downright foolish and over imaginative.  The unknown must eat their families alive like Piranha and we can only offer them our sympathy.  But the jungle claimed two more victims.  If I was Panama I would not even allow tourists to hike without a guide.",

On le voyais peut-être sur la photo effacée. Ils auraient pu facilement obtenir de la chaux, vu que le guide à une ferme, donc il doit répandre de la chaux sur ses cultures. J'ai toujours pensé que la photo à été effacée par quelqu'un de la police aussi. C'est d'autant plus suspect que le guide et son fils n'ont jamais été inquiétés. Elles ont du tellement souffrir avant de mourrir, c'est affreux. 😢",

It is plausible that the girls sort the help of those friends to explore uncommon parts of the countryside. It is possible that the girls sensed something wrong early on in the trip. Hence the landmark photos that were being taken. It’s possible the pieces of sticks with plastics around them or a message from the girls to whoever finds the camera roll that if you can find those plastic markers, the girls were there. Because of the rumors of their ties to the social scene and gang members I think foul play is the solution here. The photos of here could’ve been of deceased bodies.",

The girls didn't get lost on their hike, as there are several witnesses who saw them come back from that trip.. But they went with 3 guys who offered them a lift home, - in the car they suspected something and called emergency - they invited them to the spring to bath, from where there is a picture... 2 of these guys supposedly the are the main attackers, the third guy was killed few days later because he knew too much. Actually more people, according to his theory where involved,.. He there was a plan layed out and they where ment for trafficking, but things turned out unexpectedly, and they where raped instead.. . And after this used / sold for organ harvesting. So when the mystical photos where taken, they where most probably already dead. The photos where taken to feed into the idea they got lost in the jungle. And they planted som of the few remains of their body there as well. Actually some of the people who helped search the area was involved, and in this way did manipulate the evidence and the story. Also of course the government of Panama are not interested in the truth because it will reveal what darkness is going on in that country, and it will keep turists away.",

In fact, one could not get lost regardless of how hard you might try. A whole team, including parents, retraced the trail, and it just isn't possible. There is literally nowhere to go except the trail itself. Not to mention, numerous people reported seeing them return. Even their photos show them going up, and then returning, as they \"summit\" twice. \n\nRumor has it that upon returning from the hike, they were invited to go swimming with an unsavory character named Henry. Henry, the swimmer, has some odd photos on his facebook page, for example, one of two girls lying unresponsive, in identical positions, with Henry standing over the girl in the forefront, holding a large stick over her head. The family they were staying with is also rumored to be heavily involved with the gang activity in the region, from trafficking to organ harvesting. As was their guide. As was everybody they came in contact with after they got to Panama. \n\nYou have to ask yourself, why were they misled by the school in the first place, and told that there were positions for them at the school, when there weren't?  They didn't stand a chance.",

You will know what psychopath work is like. next\nIn one April after taking a taxi (this taxi driver also saw these two perpetrators when they arrived at the destination) they accidentally met the psychopath (two local residents) they chatted and only two hours they were already familiar and as if they were already long Then they went on the road initially the victim was not to go mercy. (Can be seen from the bag they carry without adequate equipment.\nAnd on April 1 they have been killed by the psychopath and this I don't want to say because it's very sadistic. after they died they were mutilated and the pieces were distributed in various places some were eaten by wild boar\nand psychopathic alibi to eliminate traces made an oddity as if it would be on the second day and then the cris was still lives lost and tried to call the police (On the first day the victim's cellphone was held by the perpetrator and who called the police many times it was the culprit) and a separate photo section It was photographed by my sipe and who committed murder 1 person even killed more than 5 people and 1 more knowing about this murder was originally this one did not know because this was his friend inevitably he was involved. His spirit was in the cave and the victim there was calm and peaceful. This is just my opinion. Peace be upon you, and Allah mercy and blessings",

My belief. \nThe appearance of the remains later on, strongly indicates an accident.\nBut if the day-pictures really are faked and they never were at the mirador, then the one who have placed the backpack must had known about the manipulation because he knew the right direction.\nThe successfully entering of their passwords into their cellphones, strongly intends that they were alive till the last day.\nThe last Photo obviously shows a wig.\nThe girls made a few very bad decisions and also other persons were involved.\nThe surrounding story is just appalling.\nBut I refuse to believe that a bunch of bush people came up with such a lot of unsolveable riddles.\nI don't believe in the ultimate knidnapping case, done by a group of young panamanian guys, with lots of traces and lots of insiders and lots of aftermath but not a single clue about who and where.\n\nBut also important out of this story are the Takeaways: \nIf you go to such a country. Be sure where you go and who you meet.\nNever hike into the jungle on your own, specialy without beeing big and strong and equiped with some experience.\nAlso don't follow somebody unexperienced into the jungle, for he could loose you not knowing what to do.\nWith bad luck, none will come to your rescue.\nAnd last but not least, the most important lesson of all: If you want the true crime community to solve your case, show us all the evidence and clues. Dont hide anything! You will come under suspicious yourself. We will find everything out, by intention or chance. We wont leave a thing out and we will never stop.",

Like how the dog accompanied them up to the trail and came back without them. This is a fabricated story that was told by an elderly guide who son has been in connection of the disappearances of the girls. An easy way to start a story on how they first knew that the girls were missing. Theres a lot more information to this entire story but you REALLLLY have to look for it in the right places. This story took up an entire month of my free time to only realize none of it mattered because its not like i could make a difference about it anyways. These two poor girls were set up from the very beginning the moment they set up plans with that school. I just wish they felt something was wrong when they arrived and were told they were there a week early. Huuuuuuuuge red flag from the very beginning. This problem made the girls venture out into the open and of course, the people who took them; they knew about that very fact. Most of those photos, if not every one; is photoshopped to a degree. With an entire img# wiped off leaving only the # in its place, showing someone had tampered with it through a computer. This is one of the only bizarre cases out there that I have dug into as deep as i possibly could. To the point i was letting it effect the way I imagined everyone around me. Its all sad, everything that happened. Nothing gained, only holes where peoples hearts used to be. R.I.P. Lisanne and Kris.",

To people who have hiked it before, sure, but there are plenty of areas where one could take a wrong turn and yes there are dangerous areas on it where one could fall and get seriously injured. So yeah it is quite dangerous to walk it for the first time without a map & compass, without a guide and without GPS, with half charged phones. However it likely would have been fine had they simply walked back once they reached the top. \n\nThe disastrous decision they made was to carry on down an unknown path. Likely they were on a high and wanted to carry on exploring but that's a very dangerous thing to do considering how ill prepared they were. They clearly got lost and most likely one of them at least got injured and they carried on hiking deeper and deeper into the jungle, tragically sealing their fate. The photos on their camera prove at least one of them was alive and that the other girl was at least there with her, several days after their disappearance so the talk of foul play is nonsense. As for why they'd take the pics, it's either for light, or because they thought they heard someone nearby and wanted to get their attention or because they're utterly deranged at this point and their actions make little sense. \n\nPeople want to turn this tragedy into some spooky conspiracy murder when actually, all the evidence points to two girls getting lost and drying in the jungle. Let it rest.",

Comme c’est eux qui on retrouvé les ossements? \nJe pense que Paolino était vieux et connaissait la police et les conséquences si il parlait, mais les jeunes? Peut être qu’ils vivaient avec la culpabilité et qu’ils voulaient ou avaient peut être parler ? \nTout est si bizarre mais je pense que c’est un accident mais il y a un élément tierce qui a joué dans cette histoire, animal ou humaine?

However, considering the rocky terrain and the pitch blackness, isnt possible that chris hit her head somehow, after a fall perhaps and the photograph was to check for any damage. Considering its a jungle, her hair might’ve been to sweaty to feel any bleeding so the photograph could've been a way to check for blood. That’s just the first thought that comes to my mind.",

It’s not normal for a woman to take off her bra and carry it around like that, esp if they’re in a life or death situation (the bras should be the last thing on their mind).  To me that proves even further that this was foul play, most likely sexually driven.  And it’s also very abnormal for someone who’s “lost” to abandon their backpack, potentially life saving items.  Also, why are they so certain that the girls were the ones who called 911 and took the photos?  If it was that gang who killed them, they have obv been to the area many times, so they knew there was no service there.  And what better way to make it look like an accident than to attempt 911 multiple times and take a bunch of photos?  Then they scattered a few body parts around to make it look like an animal ate them, and buried the rest of them somewhere else.  Being the majority of their bodies missing, it def gives the illusion of being eaten by a predator.  This gang is prolly an expert on making murders look like accidents 🤷‍♀️",

If Kris went before Lisanne, Lisanne may not have known her passcode to get into the phone. The bones being so far apart could be from animals scattering them. Starvation and delirium may have set in. The photos may have been the girls trying to tell a story of what happened. Or just using the light from the camera. One may have taken a photo of the other passed away and decided to delete it so her family wouldn’t see it. Probability, maybe? this does not however, explain the backpack with their items being found , unless someone found their items and placed it where it could be found to let authorities know that they probably had 2 females (bras) missing people in the jungle. Especially if one of the many tribes people found them or their items. The tribesmen wouldn’t have use for  the technology. We have all probably heard the horror stories and legends about the tribes and cannibal tribes of the Jungle. The bleaching marks on the bones is suspect for that.",

The police’s neglect of the fingerprints on the phones and the neglect of investigating the tribe in the area is something strange, because if there is a primary suspect in this case, they are the tribe, and the dog. What about the dog? Dogs are considered one of the smartest creatures. Why wouldn't they take him to follow their scent or take them? If the path he came from wouldn't have been neglected? Well, there is negligence on the part of the police and there is a great deal of cover-up of the case So that this geographic spot does not lose its value as one of the best tourist places.

        "text": "11:53 is this the first stream crossing, the second stream crossing or none of the above? Whenever I see videos of the first and second stream crossing they look completely different to this area. This is definitely the location from the photo; you can even match up some of the rocks that are in the same location. Does anyone know where exactly it is or what it's called? It doesn't seem to be either of the main stream crossings that people have marked on the map. Where would this take you if you went downstream? Has anyone ever tried going down there to see where you'd end up? I know that it's not exactly very likely and it looks like the girls continued down the path but there is the off chance they went down there in search of a waterfall or just out of curiosity. From this point on if we travel another 2 hours you would just end up in the paddock/open meadow area. We should also consider the girls could have taken a break at some point around this time and from this point on it's not clear at what point they turned around or where they would be exactly when they called emergency services at 4:39 pm. I think it's very unlikely they continued forward in a straight line for that long unless they thought the trail looped around. Even if they did, once they called for help why wouldn't they just stay in one spot and wait until next morning to return? They had to have left the trail at some point and there couldn't have been a catastrophic accident because they kept calling emergency services for days and we have the night photos which prove they are in a different location that isn't on or even near the trail due to the different vegetation and width of the river/stream they were close to.",

The fact is; both girls were Savvy enough in photography not to Waste time with such Random insignificant Shorts !\nThe other most important question is that; both girls were familiar and keen enough to journal and record Their adventure (whether good or bad) and they were in the habit of writing and keeping a journal. So the question is; how come if they were in trouble and they were trying to reach out, how come they didn't record with their own voices their dire situation and leave a voice record of the trouble Or difficulty they got into !? \nThey had enough battery power and it would've been the first thing anybody would do in such situation, which is; to write or voice record their predicament, just in case if somebody would find their phones and the camera Later ? I think this last great question should've been the center of the investigation. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that those girls were killed. RIP.😢",

For him to be the guide that he was for as long as he was, to have all of the involvement that he did in this from being the \"hired\" guide to looking through their bedrooms to finding their remains and etc, I've always wondered if maybe he was somehow working with or had some type of relationship with a/the tribe(s). He would have been an easy person to pass anything to who could get it back to his own home (NOT all that far away from the discovery of the remains)  and that could account for the potential that Lisanne's foot could have been refrigerated to slow decomp, Kris's pelvis could have had a chemical agent added that caused the bleaching and quickened decomp, the ability to delete a photo by plugging the camera into the computer, the backpack and all of its contents being undamaged or having any signs of weathering or mold/mildew, his ability to control the narrative, even having a woman from the tribe turn in the pack...I could continue. AGAIN, this is COMPLETE and utter speculation, but so far it's the ONLY theory that I can find the most possibilities for before I hit that inevitable wall that we do with every other theory where it stops seeming plausible.",

The most likely explanation is they reached the summit (Mirador) but instead of turning back they continued (proof is in plants and terrain of the night photos), the sign saying end of trail wasn't put up until after their deaths. They attempted to cross a monkey bridge over a powerful river, consisting of two wires for hands and one for feet. One lost balance and fell into the river, this caused the other to fall due to shaking of the wires. The fractured bones for the recovered boot with the foot inside proves one of them fell from a high point. No third party would have allowed them to keep their phones or camera, no third party would have staged the night photos and guessed the Dutch emergency services number, no third party would have faked the twigs/plastic bag, and used the end of a Pringles tube as a signal",

Then the serial killer folded the other girls clothes. The girls bone looks like its almost rotting and the other girls bone looks like it was bleached and the bag that the investigators found was the items the girls used to survive but insted they died. And thats my thoughts of how they died but remember this is just a theory they haven't solved the mystery yet",

Il s’agirait de malfaiteurs qui auraient voulu les dépouiller, les séquestrer, pourquoi pas pour une rançon. L’une des filles aurait tenté de s’échapper des jours plus tard et se serait éclairée avec le flash de l’appareil photo d’où le nombre de clichés. En actionnant frénétiquement l’appareil il est également possible qu’il s’enraye. Donc impossible de récupérer l’image. Je ne crois pas au technicien (dans la jungle panaméenne?) qui vient supprimer une photo mais ne détruit pas entièrement l’appareil. \nElles ont dû vivre l’horreur, qu’elles trouvent le repos éternel.",

Then after hiking deeper into the jungle, couldn't find their way back. They got lost. Jungles are full of thick foliage where it's easy to get lost in. They only had a limited amount of water, quickly ran out, along with any food they may have had. They eventually succumbed to the elements after separating. The explanation for the scattered remains was due to wild animals, either that or due to natural elements, such as the weather. There are six species of wild cats, such as the jaguar and puma that live in the jungles of Panama.The explanation for how the remains decomposed can be explained by forensic science. The strange photos, they were taking weren't photos but them using the flash to see their surroundings at night. The one girl losing access to get into the phone was due to forgetting the code, because of dehydration and lack of food. These girls were very young, and were inexperienced when it came to making sound decisions when hiking out in a jungle, in an area they weren't familiar with. They were full of hubris to go hiking off trail. Tragic nonetheless that they ended up losing their lives.",

        "text": "Unfortunately, too many clues point to foul pay. IF they had become lost, they would have tried to contact for help and/or the search would have found their trail or clues during the search. IF an accident had happened, their bodies or one of them would have been found whole. A photo is deleted exactly after they became missing, and all photos after that are weird snapshots that make little sense. Someone seems to have tried to access the phone by attempting to guess the password, which the girls themselves wouldn't have done unless in a fugue state but again, if they were indeed in some dazed condition, they would have attempted to get help or get out of the trail, which apparently never happened. Getting lost from the trail also seems very unlikely for that particular area. Additionally, IF foul play was the case, the perpetrator(s) would most likely choose the river as preferred setup to make it look like an accident, and that would seem to be the case. Then the weird involvement of that gang and the suspicious deaths surrounding it only strengthens the foul play scenario. THen also to consider, countries like Panama are well-known for kidnappings and murders of tourists, usually women and children. But as per usual, law enforcement in such countries is below par, dare I call it amateuristic and in some cases even involved. Not claiming such is the case here but indeed, the case leaves a lot to be desired. My heart goes out every day to ALL men, women and children that meet their end on this sickened Earth. And many thousands upon thousands do perish each and every day which I try to be fully aware of every second of every day. <3",

In addition to adding an  implausible   hypothesis of an alleged kidnapping by a local gang in the middle of the forest and still returning with the two on the same frequented trail, taking them to a nightclub!  What is missing to at least begin to evaluate something is a topographical survey showing the exact location of the photos where the two appear last. The location of all houses in the vicinity of the point in this last photo and who are its inhabitants. The exact location of the two rope bridges. The volume of water in the river in those days. The exact location where the backpack and bones were found. It is known that animals can scatter bones. I don't know if an examination was made of the heel bone that was inside the boot to find out how it was separated from the rest of the leg. And there are still many other details and testimonials missing that I don't have space to expose here.",

        "text": "Personally, I think it’s pretty clear they got killed. These girl kept a diary, took many photos and videos and you’re telling me they didn’t take a single photo or recorded a video after they got lost? Like others suggested, I find it really strange that they didn’t record a short video (or wrote at least in the iPhone’s notebook) explaining what happened to them. Especially when they were close to the end and lost all hope, you’d expect them to leave some sort of explanation for their family so they can find peace. I think this is what any of us would do in a similar situation. Also, how the backpack randomly turned up in good condition after 2 months? I also find it very strange that more remains were not found. Even if wild animals fed on them, they don’t eat the bones so you would expect more of them to show up. Where is the skull, rib cage or the femur? And on top of that you’re telling me that the 2 gang members died shortly after they disappeared and others have gone missing too? The Panamanian police is either extremely bad at their job or they learnt exactly what happened but decided to cover it up. If they ruled it as a murder, it would have driven away all the tourist from Panama for the foreseeable future which would have really hurt the country. So they were probably “instructed” to rule it as an accident. It’s really sad because these two poor girls will never get justice for what happened to them and who knows how many other victims might have been before and after them.😞",

One of the last photos taken has been forensically modified to help brighten the picture. You can see a large cat. Leaving this picture on the phone was a fortunate mistake on the part of the first agency to view the photos. Any clear pictures of a jaguar would have been erased, before it was released to the public. The girl was smart to create as much of a reflective surface as possible to temporarily flash-blind the jaguar. From the summit point, one of the young women saw how easy it would be to travel along the river all the way to the north coast, rather than turn around. The ginger girl, in one of the later pictures, was really uncomfortable with the idea of following the riverbank. A jaguar's main hunting area is the riverbank. Jaguars have one of the highest bite strengths of any animal. When a cat chews bone, it grinds it into a paste. The only bones left with mountain lion attacks tend to be the flesh they couldn’t get out of the footwear.",

        "text": "There is significantly more odd circumstances in this case.  Their taxi driver, and the two young men they hung out with there, all died under very suspicious circumstances not long after.  There are several reports of local tribes snatching people and killing them in their jungle temples.  Not to mention the local drug cartels - why do you think they are Mexican cartels?  Every single person from the story has some shady story including the tour guide who insisted he search their room the second they weren't there to meet him (why?), and the woman coordinating their program with the local children, who told them they couldn't start as planned/scheduled, and suggested they go on the hike instead. \n\n I find it incredibly difficult to believe their was no human interference involved, and lean towards them being kidnapped, killed, bones bleached, with the remains and carefully preserved belongings being planted on the trail so the Dutch would stop looking and go home.  Perhaps the girl with normal remains had died from an injury, and the other was picked up by a local tribe/cartel to be \"processed\".  A local tribe makes  more sense considering the phones were accessed for days, and they wouldn't have any idea what the devices were.  An additional confusion, is that the camera had one photo deleted from the sequence via a computer,, but that could be explained by the local police deleting an incriminating photo prior to letting the Dutch investigate.  They were known to protect their local tourism industry at all costs.",

        "text": "Killed by a jaguar. There are regional governmental conservation efforts to protect the jaguar. Any official autopsy would tend to block jaguar predation as a cause. One of the last photos taken has been forensically modified to help brighten the picture. You can see a large cat. Leaving this picture on the phone was a fortunate mistake on the part of the first agency to view the photos. Any clear pictures of a jaguar would have been erased, before it was released to the public. The girl was smart to create as much of a reflective surface as possible to temporarily flash-blind the jaguar. From the summit point, one of the young women saw how easy it would be to travel along the river all the way to the north coast, rather than turn around. The ginger girl, in one of the later pictures, was really uncomfortable with the idea of following the riverbank. A jaguar's main hunting area is the riverbank. Jaguars have one of the highest bite strengths of any animal. When a cat chews bone, it grinds it into a paste. The only bones left with mountain lion attacks tend to be the flesh they couldn’t get out of the footwear.",

Then both fell off a cliff and were both badly injured. Kris sustained a head injury and Lisanne broke her leg. The reason why there are long gaps between emergency calls is because they were in the same spot and were immobile. The night time photos are all takes in the same spot near the cliff face. There was and SOS sign made out a torn up paper map, there was a branch with red plastic bags used as a signal. They were using the camera flash as a signal out of desperation because at that moment Kris was dying. Later Lisanne passed away from starvation and dehydration. Then later locals who knew what happened found their bodies, and then used fertiliser to speed up the decomposition and they took the back pack which was still in good condition being sheltered by the cliff face. Then once the remains were decomposed and bones separated the locals scattered their remains in the river. There was 1 photo 509 which was deleted which might have shown who was chasing them. Then two months later the back was placed back in the jungle in a different location to the cliff face and that’s why the backpack was in such good condition.",

It would explain why there was a photo of the back of one of the girls heads because they were huddled together for warmth. Also if either of them had suffered traumatic injury which was bleeding it is also likely a predatory animal would have attacked them during the night. That could explain the photos of them illuminating their surroundings at night when their site was possibly being approached.",

Very sad ending to two lovely girls that had their whole life ahead of them.\n\nSince watching this have been reading up and watching more about this case.\n\nI was caught between them being \"lost\" then \"abducted\" based on everything presented, but two things stood out for me me: 1) The photo of the branches with red or orange pieces of plastic tied to them and what looks like metal coloured bubble gum wrappers on the rock, and 2) The backpack and two bras.\n\nI don't think they were abducted at all.\n\nThe wrappers I reckon were meant to reflect the sun and all of it was to gain the attention perhaps of a plane, helicopter or someone with binoculars. The mirror too.\n\nAs for the backpack being miles away and in perfect condition means it was found weeks before and likely near the bodies - perhaps the bras were removed to be kept. No report made.\n\nIt seems there were tribe(s) living in the jungle so this could have been a tribal member that did it - like from the Ngabe Bugle. I was going to say I'm not too sure about cannibalism until I read that last year (2020) there was an incident of it with a religious sect, however, I think that is not their case in hindsight.\n\nI think someone came across their bodies and took the bag and bras only didn't report it. And as they made local and worldwide headlines the bag was placed somewhere to be found only nowhere were they actually died and maybe the bodies were brought closer so as to also be discovered.",

The rescuers looked for where they assumed they could be, possibly they walked too far and much further than was reasonable. Rivers, when there are heavy rains, wash away everything they find in their path, even large rocks that they move from one place to another. Example: The last photo of Kris, posing on a rock, in a river with little flow, if you compare them with current photos, they are not the same, even large and heavy rocks are not in the same place.",

But it's the backpack showing up in good condition and one photo dissapearing that makes me feel like foul play or the photo deleted was done by the police. \nIf foul play is suspected then the prime suspect is the tour guide who is also a taxi driver had something to do with there deaths. \nThis review was posted in May 2022 by a Dutch girl travelling alone read; \n\n“He was super friendly, helped me, held my hand during the climbs on the pianista trail. Until I realized that that help was only there for me, not for my 3 fellow travellers. In the days that followed, I was besieged by messages, invitations.”\r\n\r\n“During a horse ride and a trip to hot springs, he suddenly turned out to be our driver (while he had nothing to do with horse riding) and he got into the hot spring. Not exactly what you expect from a taxi driver.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t feel comfortable in his surroundings and was very happy that my fellow travellers had accompanied me so that I was not alone with him, which was what he meant. In the 3 days I was in Boquete, I got constant messages asking to come to his home. I have my doubts about his intentions. As a European woman, don’t go alone.”",

The last 2 pictures are weird, she has mud on her feet and shorts and she looks worried. Not like before on the other pics. Why would a great friend take pictures like that? The other photos are totally different. \n\nWhat's very weird is the thing with the deleted photo but knowing police in that region, I wouldn't be surprised if they deleted the picture. \n\nUnfortunately a lot of videos don't mention their tour guide. I think he had some kind of role in this. \n\nI don't think this case will ever be solved. It is very frustrating and I am so sorry for their families.",

The taxi driver tipped them off of the girls whereabouts and were waiting for them when they returned from their hike. If you follow the photos you can see Lissane wore the backpack on the way into the trail and Cris wore it on the way back out. There's also a photo of them at the trailhead after they returned.",

Some kind of incriminatory photo of crooked police activities or could they have stumbeled on something that has to be hidden in the jungles?

In addition to those mentioned I've used the light from my cell phone flash to scare away animals, and the camera could have been used in a similar way.\n\nPhoto 509 was likely a glitch or error.

Also noticing throughout the video how the younger fella in the red cap and black jacket avoids being filmed or have the camera point at his face for long. He purposely finds something to make him “look” distracted. These fellas are familiar with the turf they are on.",

        "text": "Assalamu'alaikum, and the grace and blessings of Allah In my opinion, this is a murder by a psychopath (local resident) from the very beginning they entered Panama. They have become targets of the perpetrators. The culprit was Two men, one was rather fat and black. The incident occurred around the river first they were held captive and they refused to be raped then because they refused this they were killed, raped and then mutilated. Lissane died from being hit in the back with a rock and Kris was strangled to death and they were mutilated) the reason is strong because the bag they were carrying was clean and without stains and 34 fingerprints just to trick the police it seemed like they wanted to show that the outback tribe had killed her. You will know what a psychopath's job is like. advanced\n On one April after taking a taxi (this taxi driver also saw these two perpetrators when they arrived at their destination) and they accidentally met a psychopath (two local residents) they chatted and in just two hours they became friends and it was as if they have known each other for a long time. . Then they went for a walk at first just walking around tourist attractions and then they were taken to areas they were not supposed to go through. (It can be seen from the bag he was carrying without adequate equipment. And on April 1, they were killed by a psychopath. After they died they were raped and then mutilated and the pieces were distributed in various places, some were eaten by wild boars and a psychopath alibi to eliminate traces of making things happen. -weird things with night photos on the victim's camera and who photographed the victim from afar as if on the second day Kris and Lissane were still alive and lost and tried to call the police (who repeatedly called the police was the culprit) why did he call the police to outwit the police that they were lost in fact they were killed on april the one who committed the murder in the river one person even he has killed more than 5 people one of them is spanish and there is one person who knows more about this murder at first this one doesn't know his friend's intentions and goals since this is his friend he can't help but get involved . The spirit is in the cave in the cave as many as 10 spirits of psycho victims. and the victim there is calm and peaceful. This is just my opinion. Peace be upon you, and Allah mercy and blessings",

Panic can make a person confused, not thinking right..in their hurry one had an accident which probably was either serious or not. The araa is pitch black at night and they stayed put where the nighttime photos were taken. Reasons the  night time photos were taken :\n1) a source of light for them\n2) to scare of any predators (animsls)\n3) creating a signal for any search party of their location \n4) to see how bad the head injury of the injured.\nThey succumbed to the elements and passed ....but if there is foul play involved, unfortunately, the flash from the camera lead the killer/s to their location, held them captive for days .....\nThe above is my analysis  only.",

Not saying that the possibility of someone staging photos to hide their tracks isn't plausable, so don't come at me 😅",

Kris obviously died first and Lisanne stood by her body as long as she could, probably until she herself succumbed. The suspicious tour guide (Feliciano) did not follow the girls up the trail nor did he kill the girls, but he either did find their dead bodies himself or took control of their bodies after they were found dead by others. Since he very likely knew organ harvesters, he likely sold their organs to those people. The almost total lack of skeletal remains proves this. The sudden appearance of personal items perfectly preserved proves this. Lisanne's preserved skin proves this. The only foul play that took place was the foul play AFTER the girls died. The missing photo (#509), was deleted after other photos had been taken. That was probably done by the suspicious tour guide, using a computer. Kris's neatly folded jean shorts and intact backpack shows remorse on the part of the perpetrator (Feliciano.)",

They were already inadequate enough, surely they could accidentally delete a photo. Only can imagine what desperation they felt towards the end. The parents only add to it too. How can you say they wouldn't leave the trail. Obviously they left the trail and got lost. It don't take much. They could have been two feet away from the path and not of seen it.",

There are vids of her parents traveling this trail and there's absolutely no way to get lost, there's only one way to go and you would have to try VERY hard to leave the trail.  There are also 6 local witnesses who saw the girls RETURN from the hike, and some saw them get into a vehicle.  \nThey hiked up, went a bit past the summit, got to that stream where the pics were taken, turned around, back to the top, then came back down.  Then they were picked up by someone nefarious.  They were offered a ride to go swimming with some dudes, they dropped them by their room where they changed to swimsuits (reason why bras are strangely found in backpack later)  They stopped by a pharmacy on the way to go swimming, but this footage was magically Epstein'd never to be seen again because it would ruin the \"got lost\" story.  Feliciano even went to their room and spent 30 minutes in there, which is when he grabbed the stuff they dropped off after their hike so it wouldn't be found and ruin the \"got lost\" theory as well.  Then he waited 5 hours to report them missing....  His son and son's friends were the ones that picked the girls up, eventually taking them swimming.  The girls took a pic at the hot springs and that was the deleted photo.  The guys then did their thing and the girls ended up dead....  A photo was later found on one of the boys phones after he mysteriously drowned, and it shows the two girls with the boys at the hot springs. \nSome of the remains and the shorts were found near Feliciano's property.  \n  Why would they try only twice (12 min apart) to make an emergency call and then not try again at all until the next morning?. \nThe backpack, shorts, and bones were all planted later.  The camera pics were re-arranged by the Panamanian authorities to make it look like they got lost, they deleted one picture completely because they couldn't explain it away.   Several shady people from the area died in mysterious ways before the case was closed.  Locally it's no secret that the \"got lost\" story is total BS.  The locals all know they were killed.  \nPanama has a yearly tourism income of over 7 billion, they didn't want a double murder of two young women scaring tourists away.\nJust search for vids of Kris's parents walking the trail.  There's absolutely NO WAY two smart girls could get lost.  It's a single, clear trail all the way up and over.  There's no way to get lost, even her parents say that over and over again.  Lining the times up with the first emergency calls, there's no slopes or cliffs or anything they could have fallen off.",

The mouth of the cave was lined with red feathers and you can see them when you zoom on the photo. Dark Rose said Magick pulled Kris down to the cave and Lisanne followed Kris to kind of look out for her. Inside the man-made, the girls found a lot of ritual items and stayed a long time in the cave.\nWhen it came time to leave, they heard footsteps approaching and walked deeper into the forest further away from the path and their dog went back to the path. Whoever was following them corralled them back to the cave and other men appeared. The girls were then brutally assaulted and forced to eat some sort of raw fish that would purify them. \"It wasn't pretty,\" Dark Rose said. The red-haird girl had an argument with the leader and he murdered her, the back of her head is seen in the photos. The cult then desecrates their bodies after Lisann is murdered. Someone with a white box comes to pick up their organs to sell on the black.market. Their message to their parents is that it was their fault to leave the path and warn other people not to leave the path when exploring. They are at peace. I wish Dark Rose would repost the video. Edit: the smoothness of the denuded bones without any markings is probably due to flesh being boiled off the bones during the ritual sacrifice proceedings.",

Also, they should have recorded some voice messages to explain what happened. These actions were very useful in case they should die later.  Cell phones can still take many pictures even in no signal area.  They also had a working camera. WHY NO IMAGE BETWEEN DAY 1 AND DAY 8 WHEN THEY WERE OR AT LEAST ONE OF THEM WAS STILL ALIVE.  The Panama Police said one cell phone was turned on on Day 11.  My hypothesis is firm 👉They went with the Gang to swim in a Hot Spring called Caldera and the same evening they were murdered for some reasons in a house on the outskirt of that town. 🔪",

De mon point de vue, il se peut que quelques personnes se confient à un moment donné. Lorsque l'on voit la tête des personnes qui habitent la région, sur les photos, on voit bien que quelque chose ou quelqu'un les empêche de parler. C'est évident. Mine renfrognée. Regard perdu ou fataliste et à la fois absent, bizarre...Le langage du corps parle plus qu'avec des phrases. Regardez les photographies. Plus longtemps....\nLa question est de se demander qui pourrait interdire à ces gens de dire les choses... Personnellement, je pense qu'il faudrait investiguer auprès de ces gens plutôt. La région est, peut-être, \" touristique\" mais pas les gens. ils ont bien une idée sur ce qui est arrivé, pourquoi, et une arrière pensée sur le... comment. Je pense.",

I don’t know, maybe the girls got lost? Perhaps there were dozens of paths and they thought they were going right, and then there was no point in going back and it would have been more correct to go forward.\n\nI hope you will consider such a theory in the next parts of your mini investigation.",

The photo of the girl's hair : perhaps Kris fell from a height and sustained a bad head injury, possibly unconscious. It was pitch black at night, so Lisanne was trying to check the severity of the wound using the digital camera.\nEventually both of the girls would die from their injuries/exposure.\nI think, after this point, some locals may have found a body/bodies and their possessions and went through a process of trying to steal the electronics and then dispose of the bodies. When all the media attention was turned towards the case, the locals realised the futility of selling the camera/phones and discarded the stolen possessions. \nMaybe they were trying to destroy the bodies because they didn't want bad publicity to be drawn upon the local area, and perhaps even the local government was involved.",

        "text": "I think they got lost, got scared, got thirsty, low on electrolytes (a serious problem when sweating in the jungle), hungry & eventually one fell & was seriously injured (in the river drainage) - I think the uninjured girl used the camera flash to look for the other girl who fallen, as well as in a desperate attempt to signal at night. I think in their desperation, they probably had moved further than expected, so the search didn't find them. I think the injured girl either died or was in serious shape and the other moved downriver to try and get help, but she eventually died from exposure. Their bodies were probably somewhat eaten by animals and what was left was swept downriver by flash flooding (a common occurrence on that river) - people underestimate how powerful water hydrolics can be - pictures of that riverbed show a vast jumble of rocks, water carrying the bodies over those rocks could break them up. The clothing found isn't surprising - on the Colorado River, bodies of people thrown out into Lava Falls rapid are usually stripped of clothing and life jacket - so I'd actually expect that with the state of the remains. The bleached piece of pelvis is odd - but the sun can bleach bone, possibly it was stripped of flesh by the river & then exposed to harsh tropical sun. The pack is harder to explain - although I'd expect a killer to bury it in the jungle - even a few feet off the trail & it would never be found. And why would $83 be left? To a local that would be a tidy sum & taking it wouldn't implicate the killer any more than the other facts. The missing pic is weird - although if the girl was frantically using the flash at night, who knows what could happen- I thought I'd read there is a double number in the sequence, so maybe that's the issue and there isn't a missing photo in reality. The problem with reality is it isn't tidy - in so many mysteries, there's some elements that just make no sense & we have to weigh in with the preponderance of evidence. From the photos, they clearly continued beyond the summit. They were unprepared and by 4:40pm scared & tried 911 - by 7pm it was dark. A single bottle of water, no electrolytes to replace those lost to sweat and no or little food is a serious medical situation very quickly. They may have pushed forward in a desperate search for water. Eventually one fell & the tragedy unfolded.",

But by the time you find a girls foot that got cut off we know for sure a beast got her . Maybe a mountain lion ? Well it must be a human beast or one girl would have run off and escaped . Probably the beast was a gang of men that captured & killed both girls . Body parts were found miles apart . And yet , only 10% of the 2 girls body parts have been found scattered miles apart . I think something cultic or clannish took place . Maybe some sinister clannish natives thought they captured 2 Americans, and didn’t even realize they were Dutch . But first the back pack was found like as if nobody ever opened it . Maybe a killer saw the Panama news and decided he would just leave this back pack looking  like the girls just got lost so nobody would be expecting a murder drama . And maybe these girls body parts got shoveled around as show pieces to show off somebodies power as if the white skin was a trophy of some kind . A sinister scheme of showing off evil power . And the deleted photo may have revealed a face or even a location that could be traced . The FBI would have probably found something like fingerprints or a story of multiple strange fingerprints on the electronic things in that back pack , but it was the Panama law that worked the investigation. Maybe the killers took photos of the dark sky and stuff to make it look like the girls were just lost and going crazy . We see the one girls hair , but was she alive ? But I think the back pack got dropped off to make it look like 2 girls just got lost , and they just aren’t found . Criminals are smart , but yet dumb because eventually they found multiple body parts and DNA matches . Yep they are killed it looks to be for sure by a beast of some kind.",

Or was the photo deleted on purpose if they felt it made them look bad? You can apply this way of thinking to any case though. Can you really trust the official reports of someone else who might have their own agenda?",

In thinking about what could sever a foot I keep thinking about the large American crocodile. Five minutes of research tells me they can bring to bear 1 ton per square inch in bite power. They feed at night which could explain the strange flash photos if Lizanne was trying to scare one off. I also appreciate what an earlier commentor said about the possibility of tropical ants cleaning Chris’ pelvis piece off, that makes sense to me. Try this theory on for size: the women get lost quickly after leaving the main trail and try several times to reach the authorities for rescue. Chris could have removed her clothes deliberately to do something in the water, whether to reach a cleaner area to refill a water bottle, or? American crocodiles would just be making a nest and laying eggs at the end of March beginning of April in Panama. The females are said to protect the nest aggressively, though they are generally not said to be an aggressive species. What I read says that females do not meet until at least 9 1/2 feet long, that they can run 10 miles an hour on land and swim 20 miles an hour. The nest is said to be approximately 5 foot deep and 10 foot wide, filled with rotting debris, and both parents guard it hiding in holes in the bank. Lisanne could have gone to rescue Chris and both women ended up on the far side of the river away from Chris’ clothes. Let’s say Chris became unconscious or mentally incapacitated before Lisanne did, whether from lack of food or water or injury your guess is as good as mine. That would explain the later attempts to get into Chris‘ phone without the pin. The strange nighttime photographs with the flash during three hours between 1AM and 4AM on 4/8 would be an attempt to frighten nighttime predators away. I would guess that both women were eaten by either the original American crocodile(s) or their bodies were dismembered by smaller Caimen crocodiles.",

Not saying there was a deliberate cover up, but in many instances subconsciously the mind falls prey to biases  and leads one to the least troublesome explanation,  foul play is 'bad for business'. It 'rocks the boat'. 16:19 - the fact that a very important photo was deleted - the one linking their daylight hike to the night time photos after they go missing - does not feel like a coincidence to me.",

Her foot broke right where it was supposedly \"chopped off\", her body decomposed and we find that it wasn't just a normal fall she had. She had instead broken her ankle, there are reports the one lady did have a fall. Alone, in a hot and humid place with no food or water. And it gets pitch black dark in Panama around 6:30 to 7:00. If you don't have experience in the forest, you shouldn't be going out there. Some people get lost just going in 50 meters. As soon as I heard they went without a guide, I knew they were already dead. These ladies were starving and dehydrated, in an unforgiving climate that can change as easy as snapping your fingers. They came from Europe, to a climate so much more extreme they are used to. Being lost in the wilderness you feel so helpless and you hallucinate so much quicker the weaker your body is. Everything was stacked against them, there is no foul involved at all. Everyone tripping about one photo, it was obvious they had to delete things to make more room. You can delete a photo without a laptop, as long as that camera was never connected to the internet. They were two humans in an environment they are not used to. They straight up were lost, delirious, dehydrated, and starving. I doubt they could remember their pincodes after a while, again y'all don't know how it feels to be lost in the wilderness.",

One of the last photos taken has been forensically modified to help brighten the picture. You can see a large cat. Leaving this picture on the phone was a fortunate mistake on the part of the first agency to view the photos. Any clear pictures of a jaguar would have been erased, before it was released to the public. The girl was smart to create as much of a reflective surface as possible to temporarily flash-blind the jaguar. From the summit point, one of the young women saw how easy it would be to travel along the river all the way to the north coast, rather than turn around. The ginger girl, in one of the later pictures, was really uncomfortable with the idea of following the riverbank. A jaguar's main hunting area is the riverbank. Jaguars have one of the highest bite strengths of any animal. When a cat chews bone, it grinds it into a paste. The only bones left with mountain lion attacks tend to be the flesh they couldn’t get out of the footwear.",

But as is said here, it also makes sense that coming across this field for instance, to assume it might be a quicker way back or lead to somewhere inhabited.  So perhaps they left the original trail where the stream photo was taken but later found themselves in even more dangerous jungle terrain that was never searched?",

However, if someone else knew the pin this becomes meaningless.  There is the photo of the back of a blonde woman’s hair... we presume this is Kris, but could it plausibly be someone else’s?\n\nCould someone have happened upon the bag and attempted to phone it in as stolen (hence the emergency call)?\n\nThe biggest question for me at the moment is - why weren’t any more photographs of any substance taken after 1st April, especially if they had an accident or were lost.  Would this not be the first thing you would do?",

And for the emergency calls, their lives they think might not be really in danger as i said someone, a local might have assured them every now and then, and i think that debunks the theory why they didnt call their family or loved ones.",

To make a long story short the area where those women went hiking is a known drug trail, cartels use it as a route to transport narcotics and obviously if you bump into them it's a bad end on your part. The people on the show even question villagers about it as the area is populated not isolated and they weren't talking out of fear, the local police buried the case leaving the women's family without any real answer as to why they died. The officers said, \"They were crossing a bridge and most likely fell off.\"\nWhich a forensic investigater said isn't possible when it came to the bones they found plus how the human body works, the backpack also contained items for a day hike. It's truly a corrupt case and the women did head back from where they came from, it's on the way back they met their tragic end. The camera's missing photos had to have been deleted afterwards to conceal key evidence, the way the numbering works on a camera that's what had to have happened. I'm not believing in pitch darkness when you're trying to light up your surroundings, you're going to have time to delete pictures especially if your life is in danger.",

They took a hike with the hosts dog. They decided to go off track, likely to get those cliffside photos like they had been taking. One or both of them slipped and fell. It takes a tremendous force to snap a pelvis in half. Kris has a broken pelvis. The other young girl stayed with her friend. The photos snapped in the dark were likely out of paranoia to frighten away an animal, as they were in pitch black and afraid. They didn't snap the pictures to see because it would've just blinded them with brightness. After around day 5, Kris died from her injuries. The other girl tried relentlessly to unlock the phone but couldn't figure out the code. She was likely very dehydrated and unable to seek help on foot, assuming she wasn't also injured. They both eventually succumb. I can't imagine what it must've been like to be the family and know that if someone just would've found them sooner, they may have survived.",

And that video of him showing Kris' parents the way, machete in hand, makes me sick. You can also see that the mood changes in the last two photos of Kris, the perpetrators can probably be seen in photo 509, which is why the tour guide was also in the rooms and the cell phone cables to delete it. And then exactly this guide finds Lisanne's shoe with foot at exactly the right time, in a dense jungle several square kilometers in size, behind a tree in exactly the right place. All the fake reviews on Trip Advisor, NONE mentions the two girls, but emphasizes how great and honest Feliciano is? The backpack, neatly packed with its contents, is found by accident near one of Feliciano's farms, again at exactly the right time? With the money and cell phones to distract from a crime precisely because of that? Guys, I beg of you, does it get any more obvious? If the investigation had been done CORRECTLY, on the first day after the disappearance, the remains of the girls would have been discovered, as hard as it sounds, on one of Feliciano's farms and plantations. But they didn't want to risk it, tourism in this area is one of the main sources of income.",

Its Kremers who insisted on the hike without a guide for obvious reasons and ONLY one bag thank you very much. can't carry Froon with two bags. Kremers was good for a first and only kill. Bundy was 27 on his first kill. Kremers age worked against her, she was only 21. her empathic prey Froon 22. Kremers got virtually everything right for a first kill. the date and location were excellent. fools day was particulary ingenius to reveal her fake friendship to her imaginary friend. however, after the kill she makes some schoolboy errors. she completely overcooks the two phones to death making it too obvious they were staged. that's understandable considering her age but juvenile nonetheless. the shockingly self indulgent selfie on the 8th April would make amanda knox wince but belongs in the same league as jodi arias leaving the camera in the washing machine. it was also just in very poor taste. photographing her two red carry bags was not great either but less obvious to the untrained mind. she also could have emptied the backpack better, leaves too much behind. I would have got rid of all the clothes, sunglasses and the money at a minimum but she was dying at that stage so her judgement was not functioning well. In truth she will go down in history as a lightweight killer in league with Arias, hubers and mertens. she lacked class which you can't reach. one thing I did admire which was quite superb in all the planning and deserves an honourable mention is the manipulations put together to ensure there was no job at the school. i feel too much effort went into that part and maybe she was running out of steam by the time she got to the kill. she was young afterall. RIP Lisanne - you never saw her coming.",

I mean, there's so many possibilities with many endings. falling off a cliff, eaten by animals, a murderer, got lost then injured or eaten by an animal or murdered. possibilities are endless.\n\neither way, this case really intrigues me.",

Osman Valenzuela, Jose-Manuel Murgas, Henry Eliezer Conzalez,  Efrain Manuel Rios Gonzales (nickname Adonis, the rapist and murderer en friend from Henry). He raped and murdered Nuris Esther Castrellón a 50 year old lady. In 2018 at a periode of 6 months 22 woman where raped and murdered there.  The Panama city police did interrogate (the hard way?) these guys and not long after these guys are murdered. Just like the 34 year old taxi driver Leonardo Arturo Gonzalez who drop of Kris and Lisanne at the beginning of the trail. The leader of the gang was the son of the tourguide ‘F’. On the cell phone from one of the gang member was a picture (total 2) with two guys and two girls swimming at a place (Caldera area) near the trail. They say it is Kris and Lisanne on the photo’s. But you have to look well to see it. I think they are on the picture. Also Lee Zeltzer found some snuff pictures showed up at Darknet: two girls on the ground surrounded by a tribe and Kris her face heavenly beaten. Lee also died short after he finds out these pictures. (He knew to much??)

Perdre leurs filles dans des circonstances aussi sombres et à des milliers de kilomètres de leur foyer ce doit être insoutenable.\n\nConcernant la série des dernières photos, au début je me suis dit que c'était pour éclairer leur chemin, mais avec le recul ça ne tient pas la route. C'est étrange d'avoir reprit la route en plein milieu de la nuit, sous la pluie. Ça faisait déjà 10 jours qu'elles survivaient dans la jungle et je pense qu'elles savaient que marcher de nuit était dangereux et qu'il valait mieux se reposer et trouver un abris au sec. Et si on suppose que Chris était déjà morte à ce moment la et que Lisanne est resté avec elle, c'est encore plus bizarre qu'elle décide de partir à minuit passé. \n\nDu coup je me demande si elle ne s'est pas réveillée précipitamment à cause d'un danger/bruit et qu'elle n'aurait pas utiliser le flash pour effrayer quelque chose. Peut être un animal qui rodait autour d'elle attiré par le cadavre de Chris et qu'elle a essayé de faire fuir en allumant le flash en continue. Ça pourrait aussi expliquer qu'elle ai prit les cheveux de Chris en photo.",

No teeth bruise, scars on them. I can say it is bcos  the cannibal who skinned them and dismembered the body, had experience in butchering. (Nearly 50 gals and few men were disappeared b4) remember a clean butcher.\n2. Night photos: i suppose they werent taken by kris or lisanne. They were surely photographed by tribes bcos we can note the way they were taken. Some1 who doesn't know how to handle camera. Kris' hair image must have  been taken after the scalp peeling.\n3.backpack: after days it was found to us. Who will throw away a 83dollar.. A man eating people and living in caves/hideouts will definitely not need money. \nThen, kris' bones were found gathered in a place along with other men bones. This tells they dispose bones just like we throw trash in the can.\nAlso, lisa foot and fingers were found somewhere.. They were not fleshy We know. \nI found these when i glanced. If druglords or smugglers were involved, they would have not left bodies unburied or burnt.",

If they were still alive the girls would have been in the photos, they would have left some sort of message, scrawled in the mud with a stick. Their bodies were dismembered by the killers and scattered. Their bag was placed by the killers so it would be found. The dog was shit scared, that is why it went home alone.

I'd like to know if the female detective in Boquet had knowledge of the backgrounds of the taxi driver and F. Thanks so much for all the details and your analysis.

It's one of those things that once you see it your brain always makes you see it, also I have seen people's eyes look like that before when they are gone. There is an empty look to the eye.\n\nMaybe i am imagining it. But I thought I should mention it.",

The hair - either accidencal shot, or indeed attempt to check what is on the back of the head. \nSo.... either they got attacked by predator or decided to proceed on their own when they realized that the help is not coming and likely they were delirious at that time. Fell into the river, broke all their bones. Animals pulled the bodies apart. \n\nSomething like that. \n\nThis does not explain: \n - why they haven't documented the ordeal on their phones.... \n - why backpack was practically intact while the bodies were torn to pieces supposedly by the river. Had they had backpack on it would have been subjected to the same forces. \n - how Kremers's shorts came off. If she had them while falling into the river, the shorts would of been as unrecognizable as she was. \n\nIt is possible that they their stuff into backpack, put it down and then got attacked by predator, fell into the river etc...,  meanwhile backpak ended up where it ended up due to being washed down by rain.\n\nThe foul play scenario then would assume they were locked up somewhere, but their phones weren't taken away so they could  try making distress calls. OR their captors could be making distress calls knowing that due to no signal these calls could not be made to create diversion .... or may be they were trying to let they ransom demands known this way.... Then, the girls tried to escape and got offed and cut into pieces. The night photos just a diversion.",

        "text": "Great theory, however there is one thing that doesn't add up to me. If F is really behind all this, how do you explain the fact that, while the girls were already missing, he was not physically present in the jungle? The day after the girls went missing, he was going around the city asking for information on where the girls were, he even went to the place where they were staying. I mean, if F chased the girls for about ten days, basically from the moment they started hiking until they stopped both turning on their phone and taking photos, which is presumably the moment in which they were already dead, F would have to follow them all the days the girls wandered in the jungle, even at night when there is zero visibility, to avoid losing sight of them. It seems really unlikely to me that F, or anyone else, was in the jungle for 10 days with the girls without ever losing sight of them for a second. It's very easy to lose sight of something or someone inside a jungle, where it is full of dense vegetation, and especially where visibility is zero at night. It also seems very unlikely to me that F started following the girls on April 1, when they started hiking, then over the course of 10 days he went to other places, and at the end of those 10 days he returned to the jungle where he is incredibly managed to find the girls and kill them. There are 2 options for me: \n\nA) even though F may have something to do with all of this, it wasn't him who chased and killed the girls but someone else who followed them for all the 10 days they were in the jungle, without ever losing sight of them for a second. This theory it's seems very unlikely to me for numerous reasons, including the ones i listed above.\n\n B) F (or whoever committed the crime) killed the girls on April 1st and then staged everything else. The photos, the 911 calls, the girls' phones turning on. All things he did to make it seem like the girls were still alive, when in reality they were already dead.\n\nRegardless of what really happened in that jungle, and despite the fact that i don't scare easily and have read about hundreds of cases of unsolved mysteries, every time i think about this case i get chills all over my body.",

It seems that one lady was hurt badly and the other stayed with her as they both tried to get help, unfortunately the injured one died and the other one didn’t have her pin. I believe she took the photo of her head and then I believe she probably took a last photo of her deceased body but decided to delete it not wanting her family to see her that way just in case she didn’t make it and their things were found. At some point after the first lady died the other one continued to find her way out and due to dehydration and exhaustion she was injured further away and succumb to her injuries. After that it’s likely that animals scattered their bones. I can’t explain the backpack in pristine condition nor the bleached bones (unless the elements could’ve contributed to that) but it would seem that if they were murdered, the murderer would’ve buried or disposed of their remains together or at least not scattered for searchers/authorities to find. No matter what happened, I pray for their families and friends and hope that they are RIP in a better place! 🙏",

Thanks for covering this case, and thanks for sticking to the basics and not wildly speculating like most videos covering this case do. The lack of sensationalizing it makes me appreciate all of your other videos on cases im much less familiar with even more. Keep up the good work. 👍",

The main thing about the photos is WHY they'd spend several days lost without taking a SINGLE picture? Some people speculate that the night sky was clear until the night they had to use the flash to see their surroundings. But the picture with Kris Kremers's hair is very enigmatic - I cannot help noticing an eye on the left part of the photo. To me, it is Lisanne taking a picture of herself while holding the body of her friend.",

The one of the dirt bank i think is like an optical allusion its not looking down its looking up. Like they wanted to see if they could possibly climb up it to a higher vantage point.  I believe they stayed on the water in the open as much as possible up until the end... just my take on what I see",

The missing photo (or potentially video) was likely a temporary camera error (probably after getting wet) which would explain them not even trying the camera again until the 8th in desperation.\n\nThe night photos were taken in a gully with some water that the girls found themselves in, with Kris likely completely incapacitated in that place by then, and Lisanne taking them in a daze trying to signal upwards to rescuers, while also accidentally snapping a pic of her friend’s hair next to her, as well as the outline of a side of her own face, all until the battery died. April 11th phone activity could have been an erroneous water-induced signal turn-on that is known to happen, considering there were no other actions on it afterwards, or a last ditch attempt of Lisanne to try getting any use of it before succumbing to the environment.\n\nLack of texts to family could be due to them likely not having a local SIM (or one at all), so no roaming. And that’s not counting further reasons like due to insufficient credit, battery saving focused only on 911 calls, or just incomplete data accumulated. The piece of skin being Lisanne’s is also disputed, and was apparently examined to be of animal (cow) origin. The jean shorts were probably used as a pillow during the night and/or became irritating to wear; them being neatly folded instead of washing up is also likely erroneous reporting. And cleanly severed feet in shoes washing up is actually a common occurrence. Establishing Occam’s razor is not necessarily simple, but there’s still not enough concrete evidence of foul play to beat it.\n\nOne thing’s for sure though, regardless of where the thought on this case falls, the overall feeling starts with ‘what were Dutch girls doing in the wildness of Panama either way?’ and ends with ‘why were they keen for Panamanian wilderness instead of the beautiful capital of Panama City or other well-populated exotic cities in the Americas?’",

This explains why the bag that the local saw in the river was clean and untouched. One of the girls had already died that night when they vanished, and the other was held captive for unknown reasons, and she was the one attempting to make calls. The photos taken in the woods? Those who took them most likely returned to take random photos in the hopes that others would believe the girls had been involved in an accident and were desperately seeking help. The scattered evidence? Those were all set up by the kidnappers, as well as the others who provided statements, all of whom were most likely conspiring to conceal the truth.",

        "text": "Because I somehow refuse to believe that the perfect criminal lives in the Panama Jungle, I am sticking to my theory that the two young women unfortunately died in an accident or as a result of cold and thirst. The whole manipulation of the camera, the rucksack, etc. would be too perfect for me. Why all this effort in Panama Jungle? It's so easy to make a person disappear completely here. Why even take the risk of bones, cell phones, etc. being found? And then again, it's not clear enough to be able to say for sure that the two were involved in an accident. Okay in a Hollywood crime thriller, but in real life I actually believe that solving the case is probably really as unsatisfactory and simple as you might think. If the camera hadn't been found, the scenario would be so much easier to imagine. The question is, can the camera actually be ignored because the night photos were simply taken in the course of full dehydration, disorientation or is the camera the key to the case?\n\nBecause the only argument I have that points to a crime is the fact that neither the cell phones nor the camera were used to take ANY! picture was taken that would come close to explaining the situation of the two. Imagine you wander through the forest all day like in Blair Witch Project, at some point you take a break, let yourself go into the bushes and think, hey, document it, take a picture, a short video. At some point in 10 years, you laugh about the situation. Nothing, nothing at all. Not a single picture. \n\nNevertheless, there is one case that is very similar, at least in terms of the photos = Jared Negrete\nHere, too, nothing seems to fit and yet it is safe to assume that he too has simply lost his way.\nAnd if you can't prove anything anyway, you should just assume the best for the victims, that they had an accident.",

        "text": "Killed by a jaguar. There are regional governmental conservation efforts to protect the jaguar. Any official autopsy would tend to block jaguar predation as a cause. One of the last photos taken has been forensically modified to help brighten the picture. You can see a large cat. Leaving this picture on the phone was a fortunate mistake on part of the first agency to view the photos. Any clear pictures of a jaguar would have been erased, before it was released to the public. The girl was smart to create as much of a reflective surface as possible to temporarily flash-blind the jaguar. From the summit point, one of the young women saw how easy it would be to travel along the river all the way to the north coast, rather than turn around. The ginger girl, in one of the later pictures, was really uncomfortable with the idea of following the riverbank. A jaguar's main hunting area is the riverbank. Jaguars have one of the highest bite strengths of any animal. When a cat chews bone, it grinds it into a paste. The only bones left with mountain lion attacks tend to be the flesh they couldn’t get out of the footwear.",

Ou bien une mauvaise rencontre comme tu l'as expliqué à la fin de la vidéo...J'espère qu'un jour nous saurons la vérité exacte de ce qui s'est passé...Les photos restent un mystère quand même surtout la suppression d'une... sans oublié l'endroit où le sac à dos a été retrouvé mais largement après..tellement d'hypothèses dans cette affaire..

        "text": "Très contente de ré-entendre parler de cette affaire. J'ai cependant des doutes sur l'hypothèse proposée. Si les éventuels criminels avaient voulu faire croire que les filles étaient perdues dans la jungle, comment auraient ils pu composer le 112 (numéro des secours en Europe) ou se décider à essayer le 911. Ils auraient à mon avis utilisé un numéro du Panama, peu probable qu'ils aient connaissance du 112. Et puis c'est quand même plus simple de faire disparaitre (ou casser) les téléphones. Pour la photo c'est vrai que c'est intriguant mais la théorie la plus simple pourrait être une erreur de manipulation lors de l'analyse de l'appareil par la police scientifique (que le laboratoire n'aurait pas voulu admettre), aux vues des autres éléments (chambre et indices contaminés) on se dit que l'on n'a pas affaire aux experts Manhattan. Je pense que la thèse officielle tient la route bien que ma curiosité me pousserait à faire une expérience comme laisser un sac à dos semblable dans une jungle avec un GPS dedans pour voir ce qu'il devient après des jours/semaines/mois. Il y a certes des choses bizarres, parfois on se dit que l'on aurait fait autrement, que par exemple on aurait enregistré un message \"d'adieu\" mais n'ayant pas été confrontée à cette situation (et j'espère que ça n'arrivera jamais), je ne sais pas ce que j'aurais fait. En tout cas si au moins l'une d'elles a survécu 11 jours, chapeau, elle a fait preuve de beaucoup de courage.",

Je pense comme toi Lionel, pour moi c'est evident que c'est criminel, parce que les morts accidentelle ne sont pas du tout comme ca. Je pense que maintenant c'est trop répété pour que ca soit de maniere naturel. Les gens ne sont pas betes. Ils savent faire la différence. Le seul truc qui est révoltant dns tout ca, c'est ces corruptions qui empeche beaucoup de choses. C'est vrai que dans ce genre de pays, il y a aussi du surnaturel qui y joue sont role mais la ce scénario est tout a fait possible sur ce qui a pu arrivé a ses deux jeunes filles. Mais j'espere qu'un jour la vérité éclatera...C'est vrai que ces photos font flipper quand meme, et que contenait la photo numero 509? Mystere? Dans ces grandes forets de cette amérique latine, il y a beaucoup de tribus sauvages qui y vivent, ces jungles sont tres hostile.  \nMerci Lionel pour nous faire découvrir ces histoires vrai et mystérieuses. A bientot pour le prochain...",

Les filles auraient entendu du bruit et auraient utilisé le flash de l'appareil photo pour voir autour d'elle avant d'être kidnappées.  D'où les 13 adn inconnus retrouvés dans le sac. Et puis non quand j'ai vu qu'une lettre anonyme parvenue à l'ambassade des Pays-Bas au Canada disait  : \" S'il vous plaît, n'arrêtez pas les recherches, il y a des preuves, vous avez cherché au mauvais endroit, les auteurs sont libres.\" Je pense donc à un crime déguisé en accident. Les jeunes, dont parle Lionel, ont effacé la photo 509 sur laquelle ils étaient vus. La suite est évidente.   Dommage que les investigations n'ont pas été poussées pour retrouver à qui appartenaient les 3 empreintes digitales retrouvées sur les portables.  Paix à leurs âmes.",

Photoshopping pics, deleting pic 509, taking pics in the dark and making phone calls to 911 to make it seem like they survived several days in the wild before dying from an accident or natural causes. The fact that the backpack was found later on, looking brand new after having spent days in the jungle and around a river... that's a huge red flag. Also seems like the authorities want it to look like they got lost to avoid causing harm to the tourism industry which is crucial for their economy.",

        "text": "Key to this event can be gleaned from K&L's photo's. Lesanne carried the backpack on the way up, Kris carried it on the way down. This is testified by their pictures. Which means that they made it back to Boquette. The lost in the jungle story is false. Another way to see this is that 2 days after their disappearance some 45 searchers and one helicoptor looked for them and found nothing. Yet 10 weeks later the backpack, Kris's shorts and an assortment of body pieces was found. Clearly the evidence was planted.\n   To be really grim the girls were lured to Panama, by the school director under false pretenses, the main aim being the sex-trafficking trade. That didn't work out, but there was some rich local creep that needed a lung transplant. That would explain Kris's bleached pelvic bone,  as a corrupt hospital would have no trouble in cracking her ribs open and removing flesh in a vat of caustic soda.\n    The average cost of a lung transplant in USA is $250,000, so its hardly surprising that lesser members of the gang, whose loyalty might waver were systematically murdered.\n    \n    The above comment is based on testimony from a gang members girlfriend, who understandably fled to Costa Rica for sanctuary.\n\n    Margarita's comments in interview, regarding an immediate murder by a gang member being refused sex is almost certainly false, as an attempt to divert attention away from organised crime.",

I'd understand if the photos were used to create a visually appealing background, but one of those northern temperate forest photos has a bunch of junk and trash in it, and I don't understand why it was used so frequently in this video.",

You will know what psychopath work is like. next\nIn one April after taking a taxi (this taxi driver also saw these two perpetrators when they arrived at the destination) they accidentally met the psychopath (two local residents) they chatted and only two hours they were already familiar and as if they were already long Then they went on the road initially the victim was not to go mercy. (Can be seen from the bag they carry without adequate equipment.\nAnd on April 1 they have been killed by the psychopath and this I don't want to say because it's very sadistic. after they died they were mutilated and the pieces were distributed in various places some were eaten by wild boar\nand psychopathic alibi to eliminate traces made an oddity as if it would be on the second day and then the cris was still lives lost and tried to call the police (On the first day the victim's cellphone was held by the perpetrator and who called the police many times it was the culprit) and a separate photo section It was photographed by my sipe and who committed murder 1 person even killed more than 5 people and 1 more knowing about this murder was originally this one did not know because this was his friend inevitably he was involved. His spirit was in the cave and the victim there was calm and peaceful. This is just my opinion. Peace be upon you, and Allah mercy and blessings",

As it has been noted someone deleted number 509 photo off camera.\nAlso in a desperate situation like that I wonder why they didn't record a video message to loved ones on their camera? It has been noted that humans in their last moments will quickly try send a message home. They could have also used the notepad on their phones. Makes me wonder if they were held hostage and given food/water to keep them going a few more days...\nAdds up when you think their backpack was found intact and not dirty at all. \nIt's honestly a very intriguing mystery.",

The time stamp and a photo of the stars could be triangulated into coordinates.\nThe foliage can tell you a lot aswell like what part of the jungle they were in. That’s what they seem to be to me!\nThey were accosted by someone or thing.\nCrimes with more than one perp and more than one victim often show vast difference between the manners of death of the victims including manners of disposal.",

        "text": "I think the tour guide did something to them. He was very suspicious the whole time. Wanted them to stay on his ranch with him the night before the tour. Went to the host family looking for them when they didn’t show up for the tour (who does that?) and went into their room alone. Who knows what he took or messed with in there. His ranch was near where their remains were found. I think he found them on the trail the first day and talked them into going off trail since he was with them and could “guide” them, and sent the dog home. Then he kidnapped them to his ranch. Probably guiding them to his ranch to make it easier than kidnapping them on the trail. The girls thought they were lost and were calling emergency numbers but he knew they had no reception so he allowed it to keep them calm and easy to manipulate. He continued making calls once he got them to his ranch to make it look like they were still calling, but he didn’t know the code to the phone. The girls escaped after a week and that’s when they took all the night pictures, and why they were trying to find their way at night. That’s how they survived without having food or water with them, why there is a gap in photos, the deleted photo could’ve had him in it and he had to get rid of the evidence that he was there. Their clothes and especially their shoes did not show signs of rough wear which they should have if being worn in a jungle for a week. I’m not sure if he found them after they escaped and he killed them, or if they did just die from injuries/natural causes at that point and he found them after death and took them. Then he planted all the evidence to be found and bleached one’s bones but didn’t do the other one’s for whatever reason. This is the only theory that makes sense to me. As for those who say why would he go to all that trouble when he could just hide everything, misdirection works better. Make it look like they just got lost and died. If no evidence was found at all, no one would give up on looking for them and he was already a suspect. Planting just enough evidence to show they died out there served its purpose of throwing everyone off and shutting down the investigation.\nAlso, they didn’t take toilet paper with them, and probably not a mirror either, so where did it come from?",

I don't want to be stuck out here in the dark. these were smart enough girls they would have did an about face and headed back. that's why I know they were confronted right after the last photo of kris the first day. those girls were stalked and then threatened and pushed on further into the jungle. they weren't lost at all ever. and there's even a video of the family search for the girls and you can hear in spanish one of the guides tell another in spanish don't tell them anything. so something happened out there. and you can ask any woman what they think and they can tell you probably to the T what happened. just use your imagination people.",

I definitely heard this somewhere I don’t remember where, i’m not sure why people don’t acknowledged this.

        "text": "Really this incident shocked me bad.. I saw some points were strong in it. I guess this mystery hides 'cannibal tribe' act behind. \n1. Bones: they were clean without flesh on it. No teeth bruise, scars on them. I can say it is bcos  the cannibal who skinned them and dismembered the body, had experience in butchering. (Nearly 50 gals and few men were disappeared b4) remember a clean butcher.\n2. Night photos: i suppose they werent taken by kris or lisanne. They were surely photographed by tribes bcos we can note the way they were taken. Some1 who doesn't know how to handle camera. Kris' hair image must have  been taken after the scalp peeling.\n3.backpack: after days it was found to us. Who will throw away a 83dollar.. A man eating people and living in caves/hideouts will definitely not need money. \nThen, kris' bones were found gathered in a place along with other men bones. This tells they dispose bones just like we throw trash in the can.\nAlso, lisa foot and fingers were found somewhere.. They were not fleshy We know. \nI found these when i glanced. If druglords or smugglers were involved, they would have not left bodies unburied or burnt.",

        "text": "Ideas. 1.) consider moon phases, when I hike if the moon is full I really don't \"need\" a light source, would the girls have needed the flash if it were a full moon? highly unlikely. But using it as a signal light to helicopters or people passing by on trail is more likely.\n2.) in the one photo the girl in pink's hands look bound behind her. My son has a phone that snaps a picture every time the wrong code is entered, it's possible a third party stole the phone and entered the wrong code and a picture was snapped, they then got the girl to delete the photo and then killed her, but forgot the code continually only this time they knew to avoid the camera and thus we have random images being taken. \n3.) Leaving money in the bag could be a red herring in regards to bringing their belongings back, While I'm thankful someone found them or felt bad and returned them but we can't completely discount the fact that the person who brought the belongings back un wet and un bloodied (odd given the girls boot and pelvic condition as hikers keep their packs on them usually) couldn't also be involved or know more than they let on.",

        "text": "Kris led the way off the trail and into the jungle, she wanted some impressive jungle photos for her Facebook and Lisanne, naturally the more sensible, followed reluctantly, not wanting to be boring, this was an adventure trip  after all. Well, fools rush in and just as Lisanne had decided to put her foot down and insist they return,  Kris decided on one more photo opportunity, one risk to many and took a serious fall breaking her leg. Lisanne made 911 calls from both mobiles but alas no signal. It dawned on her that there was no way her friend could be helped back up the the way they came and they were trapped where they were with night falling. Bravely the girls staggered down the mountain side for 24 hours towards the sound of running water. Exhausted they made camp at the riverbank clearing by the monkey bridge and hoped to be found by someone passing through or seen from above by a rescue helicopter. Still badly injured and passing in and out of consciousness Kris was in no position to move again. Lisanne had to make a choice, leave friend and go got help or sit tight and trust that a rescue party would reach them. The loyal friend stayed but there would be no rescue and by April 8th Kris had passed into a coma and was dying. As the night drew in the animals of the jungle picked up the scent of death and a lone Jaguar stalked the area and could not be driven off by the flashlights of Lisanne’s camera. The attack when it came was swift and decisive , Lisanne already weekend and unable to defend herself succumbed to the the jungle predator and the girls fate was complete. Maybe the search party found the aftermath of this gruesome scene eventually, maybe it went unnoticed. Maybe it was better left unsaid. RIP Dutch girls",

In Europe and Netherlands for that matter, there are barely any really wild forests similar to this... and I would assume, if you have no experience in that area it is even easier to get lost.\nAlso, the nighttime photos could also be a way to get noticed. maybe they heard the helicopter and search party and tried this as a signal for help...\nIt's easy to say in retrospect that tthe flash was no use or that they could have left a message... but I guess being in a situation were you are in a panic and possibly badly hurt, being in shock.. it's not that easy.

The night time pictures taken from the same spot look like the were taken from an elevated position, at least from some form of rock that was higher than the jungle floor. And the photos of the mirror setup show that at least one of the girls was still able of rational thinking. I think it’s more likely they were staying at the highest point they could reach for the night. They could have use the camera/flash to try and scare of wild animals. That’s would explain why they pointed the camera at the same point for multiple photos. I can only image how scary it is to be in the middle of a jungle in the dead of night. \n\nAs for the washed up backpack and scattered bones. Even uninsured it’s very hard to walk through dense jungle without any paths or tools. Maybe they thought, that their best chance of finding people was to follow the river. Maybe they packed all of their stuff in the backpack, grabbed a log or big stick and tried to swim down the river and went down a waterfall or tried to climb down next to a waterfall and fell down.",

Si les premières 48h sont les plus importantes pourquoi ne pas être intervenues avant, pour moi ce sont des fausses preuves la photo des cheveux roux on dirait une perruque. Les propos dans le journal on dirait les mots d’une personne malade mentalement dépression ou autre peut-être que le voyage en question lui a fait perdre la tête. En utilisant le flash et en prenant des photos sans faire exprès la batterie s’est vidée plus vite que prévue. Pourquoi le téléphone s’éteint s’il y a 22 pour-cent c’est bizarre. Elles ont l’air d’avoir vraiment peu de connaissances en randonnée. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi elles étaient là bas seules d’ailleurs ça me semble très irresponsable. Quand on fait une randonnée on prend de l’eau ou alors des philtres à eau et de la nourriture au cas où. Et effectivement elles étaient au mauvais endroit au mauvais moment. Une mauvaise rencontre à mon avis. Et quand deux étrangères font une randonnée pourquoi personne ne les appelle pour savoir si elles sont bien arrivés etc. Le lendemain personne ne les appelle non plus. Et qu’est-ce que faisait le guide dans la chambre de la fille en question. Accident ou pas où sont le corps",

Un accident ça arrive bien évidemment, mais pour moi les appels aux secours sont des mises en scène. Visiblement ce n’est pas un endroit désert.

One of the last photos taken has been forensically modified to help brighten the picture. You can see a large cat. Leaving this picture on the phone was a fortunate mistake on the part of the first agency to view the photos. Any clear pictures of a jaguar would have been erased, before it was released to the public. The girl was smart to create as much of a reflective surface as possible to temporarily flash-blind the jaguar. From the summit point, one of the young women saw how easy it would be to travel along the river all the way to the north coast, rather than turn around. The ginger girl, in one of the later pictures, was really uncomfortable with the idea of following the riverbank. A jaguar's main hunting area is the riverbank. Jaguars have one of the highest bite strengths of any animal. When a cat chews bone, it grinds it into a paste. The only bones left with mountain lion attacks tend to be the flesh they couldn’t get out of the footwear.",

Take almost 100 photos & not a single 1 of possible injuries. 2)They're 20 yr olds you cant tell me if they were physically able they wouldnt hve recorded at least a lil short video explainin what happened, they're final goodbyes, or heck even recorded a lil ea day like a documentary of what all they faced out there. Instead they just took some photos of the sky at night and 2 red bags that wouldn't tell any kind of story to their parents. Someone placed their things in backpacks and pretended to find it. I feel like it's not the 1st time that's happened in that area to a coup pretty girls from another country",

        "text": "On the 1st April 2014 after 2pm, by which time they had turned around to go back and were retracing their steps, someone attacked and subdued Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon. Their phones were taken off them. About two hours later one attempted emergency call was made from each of their phones, 12 minutes apart. Had that been Kris and Lisanne,  they'd each have made multiple attempts one after the other. So it was almost certainly one man who knew there was no phone reception in the area, and was using each of their phones in turn. Or, or him untying the hands standing over each girl in turn as they tried to made the calls. What is strange is this entailed him already having formulated a long term plan to later leave the phones to be found. He then switched both phones off for 13 hours (inconceivable that Kremers and  Froon would have made one failed-to-connect call each to the emergency number, then both given up and switched off).  Next morning he switched the phones on, and again made--or more likely had the girls make--attempts to connect to the emergency number. There was only one call by Kremer's but repeated calls by Froon's phone,. On the third try by Froon's phone that morning, to his surprise and no doubt dismay,  Froon's phone did connect to a network. There were no more attempt to call the emergency number with Froon's phone,  and Froon's phone was left on all night, which ran the battery down. Next morning (3rd April), Kremers's phone made an attempt to call the emergency number that was the last one by either of the phones. Just think about that for a second; it had power and was having the correct pins entered for another 48 hours, yet there was no attempt to call the emergency or any other number by Kremers's phone*. I doubt that either girl was alive after midday of the 5th. That would explain why no PINS for Kremers's phone starting that afternoon. There was the photo on the 8th of Kremer's hair, but that could have been faked on her corpse. The activity without PINS on Kremer's phone until the 11th April was part of a charade being staged by the perpetrator. *Kremers's phone did not need PINs for an emergency call , nether did Froon's. No mystery.",

They reached up there fine, and then they decided to look for a great photo spot, this was probably where Kris felled down a cliff. Panic, Lisanne tried to reached her friend to see if she was alright. I think Kris was badly injured and Lisanne had to go get help, but got lost in the jungle. She tried to leave markers to find her friend, and move in the night with the camera as light. After a couple of days of getting lost, Lisanne decided to go check on kris to see if she was still alive. She found Kris dead and decided to take a pic of the back of her head. Then she tried to get back but was still lost and died from exhaustion and dehydration.",

And in accordance with the passed time period plus decomposition. Not scattered apart bleached bones, pristine backpack and its contents. The one missing photograph points to cover-up by their local corrupt authorities. \nThe murder of the taxi driver? It had to be the murderer of those girls himself.\n\nSomeone is surely getting away with murder. And I suspect it being the tour gide. \n\nThis story is very spooky indeed.

And if you look at those photos carefully, the bras they were wearing during their hike are the same ones found in the backpack. Why would they take those off and no other clothing was ever found? And that area has a lot of locals living there. Someone knows what really happened but won’t say. It’s sad, these girls just went to do some good and this is what happened :(",

Another scary detail is that some of their bones, as you said, seemed bleached. They say it was not a sun bleach, but it seemed like the bones had been... cooked clean. It's known that there are cannibal tribes in that region. They say that could be the reason the bones were distributedly found. Maybe they took one girl further with them for 'fresh flesh'. It is horrible to even think about it... Doesn't explain the found intact foot though! All we know for certain is the girls were alive for quite some time (phone records and photos) and must have been scared for their lives. I hope they had each other till the end. My thoughts go out to their families! Thank you Kyle, for covering this heartbreaking story. Greetings from the Netherlands.",

I also believe they definitely got off trail whether it was intentional or not and got lost bc I don’t see how/why they would after getting lost and worried I hate that we will never know but I’m glad the parents at least got the closure of the remains! As a 21 year old who has gone off trail on hiking trails I will definitely never do it again after this story! Also who knows how the earthquakes affected them!",

They probably fell and got hurt, tried the phones, knew little about phones but kept hoping they could get a signal.  They decided to spend the night since it would have been getting dark. After one phone died they probably just made an agreement (if both were conscious) to maximize battery by only checking twice a day for coverages/voicemails, etc. It's quite possible they had the ability to move and did so,  but were lost and would have headed in a random direction.  If you look at their photos they seem to have been stuck in a ravine of sorts (at the time the series of pics were taken), and left out red bags on a stick and papers spelling out SOS on a rock.  IMO the evidence points to a tragic accident.",

Then there's the suspicious behavior of the dude that was supposed to be their guide the next day. I realize it's a \"mini\" documentary but to omit those things is slipshod. How can anyone believe that, after such a long search, the backpack and only fragmentary human remains would be found? If they indeed fell from a monkey bridge or otherwise fell into rapids/water by accident then a) more remains would be found and b) be found earlier. Lastly, the video promises to provide an Occam's Razor conclusion of what most likely happened but fails to do that.",

Unlike the first few days, they were no longer thinking or acting clearly...\nAll those deaths mentioned might be linked, but probably are not.\nIf foul play was involved, there is no way the backpack would have ever shown up with its valuable content- it would have been destroyed or simply sold to some other tourist. The bodies would have probably been buried to leave no trace, and nothing would have been found.\nI think that it is precisely the strange things in this case that make it more likely to have been simply a hike that went very wrong ...",

By knowing them from videos, I can see Lisanna wanted to go back but Kris probably was the one encouraging to go beyond the trail. Or they met someone else during their hike and Kris welcomed that person (probably him)… that could explain why they don’t take pictures together and Kris took most of them Lisanne probably not too happy about not going back lol I know that because it always happened while traveling with someone",

        "text": "I'm going to go ahead and throw my hat into the ring here.  I think that they became a little too confident after completing the hike, that they had been told wouldn't be easy, it's very possible that they took pictures of themselves at their destination (the end of the uphill trek), where there were signs visible that they shouldn't proceed without a guide.  Feeling a surge of adrenaline rushing through their systems, perhaps they decided to keep hiking past their original destination. After all, they were able to do it faster than expected, and may not have even realized that they were straying too far.  Whether or not it was arrogance, the adrenaline, or possibly even a spur of the moment longing to want their last adventure before returning to begin their work as teachers, they continued on into dangerous parts of the hike. \n\nNow, from here, any number of variables could come into play; maybe they were very unfortunate and they wandered to non-sturdy ground, due to the massive amount of rainfall that often occur in dense tropical forests, which may have caused one (or both) of the girls to have had a bad fall, possibly killing one of them upon impact, or, while less likely, may have caused severe blunt force trauma that either rendered one of their legs /feet completely useless, heck, maybe she landed against coarse rocks that clean cut the foot off. It'd be more likely that if such a thing were to happen, say if one of them either fell, or perhaps something, such as a rock formation shifting due to any number of things, such as landslides / flash flood(s) (you get the idea) occurred at some point, and they had to amputate the foot... There's just too many possible things that could go wrong, even if they didn't stray from the trail, as hiking (especially in foreign land) can be a very dangerous activity.  Perhaps one of the girls died, and the other, who was in shock, took a picture of her diseased companion out of fear from being accused of foul play, as well as trying to mark the area in which she died at - thinking that she would be able to find her own way out, not realizing that she may have been lost, going the wrong way, etc. which may be why she took so many pictures as well.  I don't like to theorize in this much detail, so I'll stick to the key points from here.  Just remember that this is purely theoretical, and only based off the information in this video. :)\n\nOkay, as for the picture that was deleted and couldn't be restored - It's very possible, even likely, that the picture was in fact not intentionally deleted & wiped.  With the vast distance that it would've had to have traveled, it's fair to assume that the phone / camera could've had a corrupted file. Maybe due to all the photos already existing as well, there wasn't enough room for it to be stored in the first place, but devices like that will still try to create the appropriate format and file extension(s), followed by it being populated by the actual pixels of said picture.  If it lacks the room to fully populate the image, it would have already have pre-created a blank version of it, explaining the name / existence of the file, but it was overpopulated (past the maximum capacity to store the picture), it could easily have auto-deleted that blank formatted image file, which would lead anyone to believe that it was scrubbed cleaned after being deleted, when there wasn't anything there in the first place.  This also commonly occurs when the picture is taken and saved to it's NAND memory but is abruptly powered off.  When it's accessed again, it will either be corrupted, or just gone, making it seem as though the file in question did exist... ANYWAYS...\n\nThe rest is just impossible to speculate from the limited amount of details that are available, and honestly, I've already written a light novel with this comment in terms of length, lmao.  I think it was an accident, but regardless of what actually happened, thank God they're no longer suffering...  I pray that the family and friends of these girls are doing okay, as well.  It's really tragic, however, at the very least, there is closure in knowing that they are in fact dead, well, at least one of them has to be, and tbh, I do hope that they are both in a better place and not still out there, working for some drug cartel... I think we can all at least agree on that much.",

The two girl unintentionally missed the track, and went down into cliff or deep valley, where they found water spot or lake. where they decided to swim, thinking it's safe but it's not, it's a trap either by containing muddy water or slippery edges. girls took off their bras, and put them gently in the backpack and start swimming, one of them lost balance for some reason and start sinking, other one tried help but to no avail., survivor got panic, she didn't know what to do!, she starting calling emergency numbers, (but let's remember, they were in deep location which mean no signal), (normally, signal in such areas is weak on ground level forget about deep location). survivor girl spent rest of the afternoon trying to help her friend, she could not do any better, night came, making things more complicated, she started walking and getting away from the entrance, then she became totally lost. Camera photos shows sky and stars, which means someone in deep cliff looking for help from someone who is on top. Additionally, the girl was using camera flash as response/react to the sounds from the jungles which very scarry to single girl within dark jungle. Girl used camera flash to find her way not for documenting anything. for broken foot, it can be due to dead boody smashing during river pulling and moving. It was bad day, and bad choice for both. in foreign country, you must have tour guide. feel so sorry for 2nd girl, she spent her last 10 days in her life in real horrors. RIP.",

So girl in red and white stripes asked her to delete those because they were Fugly. The little orbs are just dust particles condensation in the air being caught by the light from the camera flash, which they were probably using an attempt to get light, or as he said, signal for help. Bones were scattered by animals. If it would’ve been a killer, they would’ve robbed them taking the cool camera the cash all that stuff is pretty valuable to a Panamanian. awesome story I love this channel. girls definitely got lost on their hike super sad least they were having a wonderful time before they went❤",

        "text": "That's a very interesting theory and explains a lot. I have two questions though: 1) If that was a planned kidnapping, why didn't the guys abduct the girls from a more secluded, peopleless place like near Mirador? They actually picked the girls up on the road then took them to the pharmacy during daylight where many people could have eyewitnessed them. Even if the locals were too scared to speak, those eyewitnesses could have been foreign tourists. Lisanne was 184 cm tall, it's outstanding even for European women. So I personally think that kidnapping was spontaneous (the guys had planned \"easy sex\" but the girls fought back so they were kept there by force). 2) Organ trafficking involves special equipment, operation room, helicopters. Most organs should be transplanted within just few hours of removal. How could that have been done in the jungles? Or it was expected to reveal in Pt 3? And the last question: as far as I know, during their Pianista hike Kris' parents found the stream/rocks where photos 508/509 were taken and it's not the way back - it's still the road towards Caribbean descent?",

        "text": "5 Years later, someone has explained the photos without much room for doubt. They were signalling towards Boquette, and the branch with the red plastic bag was also a signal, to mark their campsite in case someone came across their campsite and didn't see them behind the boulders they were using for shelter. It's very likely they couldn't sleep during the night due to the drop in temps and had to sleep during the day. Honestly, this is one of the saddest stories I have encountered, second only to the Titanic. It will never leave my head, it will never leave my heart. Just like the gentlemen that sank with the ship, so did the girls set up a final camp on the 8th, knowing they will most likely never be found. Kris carrying Lisanne on her shoulders, setting up a final SOS alongside the bottom of the pringles can in case it reflects off of something. She never left her friend. They sat together on a rock sending flash signals into the sky the same way the doomed operators of the Marconi room sent S.O.S until the ships power went out. Eventually they both died. Probably Lisanne first, since she had a broken ankle and infected foot. I honestly can't imagine those final days on that embankment. I wish they were afforded the same luxury as the gentlemen that chose to go down with the ship. A fine brandy to tide over deaths cold grasp as they passed on from this world. They deserved better. They all deserved better; but since life dealt them an unbelievably shitty hand that collapsed their entire lives out of nowhere... like I said... wish they could have at least had a brandy to live out their final moments in peace.",

Which makes sense. I'm interested in this case but im noob, great info. What I don't get is why they would have kept going if they knew that sunset was around half 6?

Everything on the phone was supposed to be confusing...done by members of the gang. The last pictures were taken when they disposed of the bodies. They took the camera back and deleted a photo...again probably just to be cocky. Then they neatly packed everything back into the backpack and placed it on a trail purposely waiting 2 months so everyone knew it was foul play. \nThe backpack was in perfect condition and obviously not out in the elements for two months. Also, their remains were found with bones from 3 other people...an important point you missed Dr. G lol. I think the one picture showing the back of the one’s girls head was taken when they were both already dead. \nPlaces like this have gangs that the police are well aware of. Often times they don’t thoroughly investigate things in order to keep the peace. The gangs will do things like this almost like a dog would piss on a tree. Simply to mark their territory and show dominance. It’s sick but that’s my theory and the only thing that would explain everything. \nI feel absolutely terrible for these young girls and my heart absolutely bleeds for their families. Such a sad and even infuriating (since nobody will ever be brought to justice and the families will never have closure) case. I believe that these girls died simply because they were young and inexperienced and far too trusting. Not jaded enough to know never to do anything secluded without a guide in places you don’t know and have no idea about.",

So much work for absolutely no reward. They would have just taken the bag entirely and it would have been deemed lost, you know, like the rest of the bodies? Occam's razor. The girls got lost, they fell down a cliff, both were critically injured, Kris died first, Lisanne didn't know Kris' pincode for her phone. Lisanne eventually succumbed to her injuries/dehydration/starvation. In the grand scheme of things what happened to the bodies after the accident is irrelevant, whether animals tore them to pieces (most likely) or cannibals bleached their bones it makes no difference, they died of an accident first. There was no foul play, there was no gang that came back to make red herring phone calls to the Dutch emergency hotline. These theories are just absurd.",

They may have gotten lost, and eventually perished due to no food, the elements and/or killed by the wildlife. Maybe the camera flash was used to be able to see when they heard something in the dark after the phones died. 509 could be a glitch because I don’t see anyone taking the time to get rid of 1 photo out of hundreds. Some bones could have been in the sun while others in darker area, or maybe a bigger animal got a hold of one and picked the bones clean? I know that sounds horrible but it’s a possible. Or one died days sooner than the other from like injuries from a fall or something. I believe it was accidental.",

Using the flash as a signal or perhaps to get a view of what's above by reaching one arm up and snapping pics to then be viewed on the screen. Maybe she climbed up the side as high as was possible, only holding on with one hand while holding up the camera with the other. If she were stretching to get the camera as high as possible, it's very possible that in the midst of taking the pictures she slipped and almost lost her grip due to the rocks becoming increasingly wet from the water coming down. When I almost fall but am able to catch myself, I stop for a moment and tense up to make sure I have my balance before continuing. If her camera arm was pointing down when she caught herself while gripping the camera to keep from dropping, in that moment she froze to make sure she had her balance she could have pressed the capture button and got that picture of the top of Kris' hair. It's possible Kris couldn't climb due to injury and was either standing below or more likely leaning against the wall. It's possible she was also dead at this time but could still be leaned against the wall. It's hot during the day so she might have regularly wet her hair to cool herself a long as they were near a water source. When you are lost you eventually want to find and stay near a water source, and generally if you follow a river it will eventually bring you to a town or other civilization. Maybe following the river is how they ended up trapped in the ravine. Now let's suppose their bones were scattered due to the water washing them downstream. How did they get there from the ravine? Well, it is raining. The rain or the river rising could be causing the ravine to flood. This would cause a panic and unable to climb out Lisanne began frantically using the camera flash to either survey the scene above her or possibly signal for help. If this sudden flooding happened in the middle of the night and they couldn't see it would make sense of the odd time codes. Either they both perished before their bodies floated up and were washed out or Lisanne survived a bit longer but was injured further in the flood and passed some time after. This would explain why there were a bit of remains that were not as decomposed as the rest. Bodies in water often have their feet come detached work the foot still inside because shoes float. Minerals in the ravine could have bleached some of the bones. This makes the most sense to me as far as how they could have ended up where they were found.",

The one photo of the girl standing on rocks looking back and people say she looks like she has a distraught look on her face is supposedly off the beaten path and over the hill I believe. If so then that shows that the girls went off the path and probably got lost. They were supposed to walk up the trail which leads up to the top of the hill and turn back. It was a very simple trail and I think they just decided to walk further and be adventurous. I used to think that foul play was involved but I believe now that they just got lost in the jungle and had some kind of accident. There's no way someone who kidnapped them would let them keep their phones and keep trying to make calls to 911 or take pictures of their captors or record them. People get lost in the jungle every day and most have no idea how disorienting the jungle can be.",

Was Felicianos coffee farms in the north of pianista trail ever were searched? I think that Gonzalez and his buddies (who are death now) indeed abducted girls but i think that they made the calls. And give backpack to auctorities in the hope of 30 000 dollar reward. Interesting thing is also that Feliciano talks in one interview about foul play and says that if girls get loss, vultures would be circeling around... thats exactly how it LOOK like, bones are would everywhere. Maybe girls maybe excaped between 5-7th day of the month of dissapearance. I dont think its likely, i think its likely that Gonzalez and buddies who attamp to sell organs kind of failed in their mission and tried to make it look like they get lost by making fake 112 calls, then after several days taking those photoes and finally leaving body parts around jungle which for me sounds stupid but maybe they had some silly/brilliant idea in this.",

Je tenais à la faire lors de mon séjour au Panama. J’y au vu le mémorial avec la croix en l’hommage des 2 jeunes hollandaises en haut du memorial. D’ailleurs je n’ai pas vu le panneau indiquant la fin du parcours.\nLa théorie locale (biaisée pour ne pas effrayer les touristes) est qu’elles se sont perdues dans la jungle et l’acte criminel n’est pas évoqué. \nDe mon point de vue, même avant d’arriver au mirador il y a déjà plusieurs façons de se perdre avec bcp de chemins qui se croisent.\nNous avons du rebrousser plusieurs fois notre chemin. \nLe terrain est compliqué et humide. \nEt quand on arrive au mirador, rien n’indique qu’il s’agit dudit mirador et on a très envie de continuer la randonnée. \nA mon sens, elles ont du continuer après le mirador par erreur en pensant que la randonnée n’était pas finie.\nEnsuite, elles ont du inévitablement se perdre.\nS’il n’y avait pas cette histoire de cette photo 509 je serais intimement convaincu qu’elles sont mortes après s’être perdues mais cet élément est très intrigant. \nSoit il s’agit d’un bug de l’appareil, soit elles se sont d’abord perdues et ont ensuite fait une mauvaise rencontre dans la jungle… en tout cas ce qui est sûr c’est que les possibilités de se perdre dans cette jungle sont infinies …",

Start from the the most obvious thing: that they were a couple of strikingly attractive young women  in an isolated area without phone reception, who would have been defenceless, and thus a tempting target for predatory men. The propinquity of what was left of their bodies,  bones being fragmented into shards (especially),  and one set of remains showing signs of being chemically stripped of flesh makes it ludicrous to think the most plausible explanation is accidents and exhaustion. The sinister night photograph of the back of Kremers’ head shows blood; they were being forced by their captors  to walk into a more secluded area, the flash was for light. I strongly suspect they were followed from the town, realized it and tried to call for help but got captured and beaten, then forced  deep into the jungle possibly to some shack. The bodies were pulverised and disposed of later.  Sadly, when police are confronted with an unsolvable crime they have a powerful motive to write it off as probably not due to foul play. I'm old and over the decades have seen it repeatedly.  For example the Babes in the Wood murders (Epping Forest), and the Disappearance of Natalee Holloway, and the case of Julie Ward.",

Bro im crying this case scares me and also whats strange is what if the killer or whoever deleted 509 and then took random pictures but first took a picture of the girls hair and then scattered pictures of randomness because why would there be a picture of a rock of all things?",

I think the night photos were possibly them deciding to stay put, due to extreme hunger and thirst, or perhaps kremers was injured/dying, so they tried to get as high up as they could w some clearing in the sky. I think they were def using the camera for light and decided they weren't getting anywhere/never got cell service again & were just wasting energy, so perhaps they would try to stay on top of this ravine (esp. if kremers was injured or dying) and make an SOS sign w a reflective device to try to get a helicopter's attn flying above. This was their last ditch effort to try & get help 😔The bags on the twigs could've just been trash they found & decided to utilize to try to signal a helicopter as well (u would hope they'd be using binoculars). That also explains why the final cell service check was the next morning and no further pics followed, and they died soon after. The only thing that's weird about that to me is if they both died after 10 days, can't ppl survive longer w/out food/water? But then again they were hiking for 10 days straight in the jungle, so i dunno.\n\nI don't really suspect foul play simply bc a killer could've easily made their bodies/bones & backpack/camera/phones disappear completely. Why leave any evidence to be found somewhere it's easy to hide evidence?",

Murder would make it unlikely to leave remains, after all. And everything else can be explained with circumstancial explanations. that missing image could have been easilly just erased after taking the later one, it being a reshot for example. Strange the what Im supposing to be a reshot isnt public yet. Question is whether #409 and 410 are nightime photos are still regular ones. the emergency calls, nothing to be said. The phone logins actually also could make sense, for example the other girl trying to log onto her friends phone, not knowing the pin because the other already died or something happened to her.",

Surtout le dimanche qui est une journée un peu morne, mais vous l'égayez ! Et petit compliment en plus sur votre apparence : vous vous êtes mise très en valeur ! J'ai suivi votre enquête, je pense à la thèse de l'accident mais aussi criminelle à la fois. En effet les 2 soutiens-gorges retrouvés dans le sac à dos ne me mettent pas à l'aise, ni les indigènes, ni les petits jeunes. Et oui, pourquoi n'ont elles pas fait demi-tour ? Lisanne avait certainement besoin de repos, elle a peut-être été blessée effectivement. Et elles ont certainement appelé à l'aide avec le flash de l'appareil photo ! Dans un sens comme dans l'autre, elles n'ont pas trouvé d'issues et cela est très triste ! Paix à leurs âmes !  (autre élément troublant : c'est comme si Lisanne avait prémédité sa mort dans son journal intime!) La morale dans tout cela; soyez prudents, ne vous embarquez pas dans des sentiers trop compliqués, anticipez vos efforts et vos parcours et avoir une autre solution de rechange ! Bon dimanche à vous ma belle ! J'adore vos histoires !",

The deleted picture could be of an embarrassing pose. Nudity perhaps (going for a swim?). One of those candid shots. If one of the girls began to suspect they might die and the camera found later, she might take the time to delete it, not wanting that to be widely seen. Or, the more sinister motive, someone who did not want their picture taken. The loss of night vision caused by the flash is easily overcome by just shutting your eyes when you push the button. It would seem a person would learn that pretty quickly. At the least close one eye. Cover it with your hand, as well as, closing it if possible.\n\nAlso, as to using a computer to \"wipe,\" the file as opposed to  simply \"deleting\" it, there is software for doing this that works right on the phone, no external computer needed. Though I don't know if it was common at that time.",

        "text": "When you look at the pictures they took\nU can see that the 2 boys play a big role in many of those pictures \nI don't wanna say that they killed the girls\nBut don't u think that things seemed to get weird?\nOK listen \nI believe that the girls took of their bras because it was very uncomfortable for them to wear it at that weather and then jumped at the water with the other two boys, then things started getting bad. I believe that the taxi driver was waiting for them (which explains who took the picture of the boys and the girls in the river) we know one of the  girls already had a bf, so she was possibly not interested in any of the other 2 boys.However, I believe that the other girls was interested in them and happy to have them. So, they are having fun at the river then they are done and get ready to leave the river. While leaving and before the  girls get their bras back from the backpack  the boys approach the girls. They invite them to come to a private place to have FUN . One of the girls accepted while the other refused. Maybe their was an argument as well.\nWe all know that the 2 boys had a good relationship with the taxi driver (who lied to the police when he was asked about the time of dropping the girls at that placd).Probably the 2 boys told the taxi driver that they need his HELP and then they dragged one of the girls and killed the other one. OK that doesn't make sense right?\nI will explain further\nIn a rush, they thought that they killed the other girl but she wasn't killed. Or at least she was faking that she was dead. It was approaching night so they boys didn't bother their self to hide her body becauseno one will be able to see her at night. Maybe they just dragged her in a hidden place so that no one also notices her in the morning. The other girl is locked at the taxi with the two boys and the taxi driver. She didn't get her bras back, she has no phone and she saw her friend killed. So I would probably say she was scared and screamed for help so the 2 boys started beating her inorder to stop screaming or maybe they put a tape on her mouth. (People near the jungle said they heard girl screams coming from the jungle that night)\nThe taxi driver drops the 2 boys and the girl at a specific place and then he leaves. On the other hand, the other girl gets awake at the middle of the night in the jungle and starts looking for the backpack. She uses her own phone inorder to call for help but after sometime her phone gets to a 0% so she tries to open the phone of her friend but she fails because she does not know the password. On the other hand, probably the other girl was killed. The 2 boys planned to go and drop her body parts scattered at the jungle and then they will cut the other girl as well(probably they hired someone to do it). The boys gets shocked when they don t find the body of the girl they thought they killed. Probably the girl didn't see them dropping her friend's body as well. When lisanne finds her friends body she took the photo of her head back. Maybe at this time she encountered her body at the dark night so she took the picture inorder to know what was that. But more probably she took the picture inorder to see if the 2 boys injured her friends head or not.\nI think this gives u know a better look of the pictures right?\nProbably it was just parts of her body not her full body. I believe that she was cut into pieces and the boys distributed her body all over the jungle. The boys go for on last visit to see how things are going and then they are shocked to find one girl alive. They kill her and cut her into pieces as well\nNote: the 2 boys and the taxi driver was killed after the girls disappearance \nI believe that police did that when worldwide media started focusing on the boys and the driver. Police knew that the boys and the taxi driver might get the police into trouble if they admit they do it or at least if say anything thing wrong.\nWhy was the backpack organised and clean with the bras inside  away from the location of the body of the girls?\n\nSimply  because they were dragged away after coming out of the river. Before getting into the river the 2 girls did put their bras inside and organised it. I believe this was the last time anyone would open it again.\nSo if we look at the pictures we can see that the boys already knew the girls way before the day of disappearance and they had a very good relationship",

They thought they had a week to explore a little so they went farther and got turned around in the dark. That happened to me on a day hike and I ended up miles away in the opposite direction of where I thought I was going. Maybe both got bitten by a venomous snake on the calf or thigh and had trouble walking and passed out. They tried calling the emergency number but got nothing. The venom is making them very sick and they can't leave the other to try to go for help. They try the phones some more with bad results. Eventually one goes unresponsive and the other doesn't know the code for the phone so she cannot try to call any more. First one dies and the other can't do anything to help them. She can't prevent insects from laying their eggs but her movement scares away larger scavengers as the flies eat it. Soon, she dies too. Nothing prevents the scavengers now. The fly maggots cleaned off the first set of bones. The other was maybe eaten by a jaguar or tapir or skunk. And somebody found the backpack and moved it after they realized there was an international search on for it and they didn't want to be blamed. I think something like that story would be most likely from the detail you gave.",

Also since the phone was turned on and did have signal yet the wrong pass key was typed in at that point bc girls had unfortunately more than likely already passed, can’t they not triangulate the area in which the signal came from. I’m assuming they can’t get an exact location or anything, but I feel like bc it actually was getting signal from somewhere at that point then they should be able to triangulate the area. I would literally bet money if they could do that that tour guide f’s coffee farm is in that triangulation.",

        "text": "Maybe they didn't take a photo at the 2nd small river because they were already tired and somewhat covered in mud. It is not inconceivable that they had both slipped before and begin to feel stressed. They were not clothed good for this kind of walk. They had no or very little food. They had no fresh water and probably decided not to drink from the rivers at day 1. I suspect that they walked on as quickly as possible, believing or hoping that they would end up back in civilization. Perhaps they thought that walking further was shorter than turning around the Pianista trail. It is very good possible Lisanne broke her foot at day one a few hours after they reached the top of the trail. Walking a foot can quickly lead to wedges in the bad jungle grounds. Then turning back was no longer an option for them and a walk back was very long. They were trapped by the medical problem. Of course Kris would not leave her friend alone in the jungle for the night. Perhaps they decided to seek help from houses along the paths. With a broken foot, no one can walk well, especially not very far and not fast. I think there is a good chance that they left the path after reaching the top. Maybe they feared the cows on the path, maybe they feared the men on the path. Maybe they were just curious to see some more of the jungle. They didn't know how dangerous this jungle could be. Everything indicates they left the path, lost track and got in troubles at day one. Probably they soon became lost and panicked. After walking around in stress for a few hours, Lisanne broke her foot, making it very difficult to walk on fast. So they called emergency numbers, to no avail. Then they spent the night in the jungle and in the morning they slowly continued the search for the path or following the river. They didn't take pictures anymore after the last picture of Kris. The only reason they didn't I can imagine is because the camera's and phones were too wet. They could open but no apps could be used for a few days. The night pictures: probably taken to sign to a helicopter or maybe they've (or one of them) did hear human voices. Real voices or voices due to hallucinations. Given the circumstances that is possible. They would only us the flash of the telephone in that situation if it could give them a chance to get in contact with people. Did a helicopter searched the area that time? Did any plane cross the sky at that time? What triggered them to flash the camera to sign? They were close to water at that moment. The person who used the telephone camera just flashed light in a circle to heaven. Was it a S.O.S?\n\nEverything that dies close to the river there, ends up in that river there. But perhaps they ended up using one of the dangerous rope bridges in the end, on April 11th or 12th, if then they both were still alive... Because they had no chance to try anything else because Lisanne had probably already broken her foot bones on April 1th and developed serious bone inflammation in the following days, due to open wounds on her legs or because of the broken foot. Both women probably decided to try the dangerous bridge because it was their only chance to find people. They put all their belonging in the bag. Kris must also soon have had a hard time physically as she was also lightly dressed and insects and plants damage the body in those conditions there. One night in the Panama jungle is enough to make two young women very ill. Both got fever and ill and must have weakened very fast. Did they fell off the rope bridge due to exhaustion and Kris then broke her hip shortly before they drowned?",

        "text": "Lisanne pronounced close to Lisahnah/Lisahneh. If you leave off the last e, it's like saying umbrell instead of umbrella. IMO Lisanne had been having premonitions against going on this trip for some time. Of course the problem with this sad case is that there is no one decisive clue defining whether it was misadventure or foul play. Except for one comment by a Spanish speaking doctor on another site stating that if the girls fell into the river their bones would have scrape marks on them from being rubbed against the rocks by the flow of the river, but they didn't. Also some say that the taxi driver said that he dropped the girls at the trail start at 3pm. But their photos show time beginning at 11am. What if the cabbie actually picked them up at 3pm but said he was dropping them off in case he was seen in the vicinity? Then abducted them?",

My initial belief was that they were abducted and killed on the night of April 1st. I thought those 90 photos were actually taken by the perpetrators, and that they were also the ones making the emergency calls. But I believe the guide and his collaborators were responsible for this. Thanks to your video, I understand 100% that these girls actually returned from that path and returned to where they came from. Finally, the people mentioned in the video lured them into the river and then into a house or cabin there. What followed was a disaster. Osman's murder and your writing also support this. I don't know why Part 3 hasn't appeared, but I hope you're doing well, and I think you did a great job. Greetings from Türkiye.",

Today, 01 April 2014, marks the 10th anniversary of Kris and Lisanne's disappearance. Local witnesses testimony and the doctored photos on Lisanne's Canon camera clearly point towards the abduction and murder theory. As mentioned, the sudden appearance of the packback (with its contents in pristine condition) and bleached human bones were only a means of trying to reduce the strong local and international concerns over the girls disappearance. Funny how it was always the local guide, Feliciano, who would find these items. Finally Lisanne's father now knows what happened to the girls. However he had to sign confidential secret agreement with the Dutch Government.",

Anyway, Indians would hardy have left the backpack so close to their own village. Kris would have had to be dead for three days in the night photo because her phone was properly accesses with both pins up until the 5th. Her clean dry hair makes that very unlikely.  And because there was no attempted emergency call  (or any type of call) on  Kris's phone after the 3rd she would have had have given up trying to call yet still able to and knowing she could because she was switching on and entering the accessing codes for two days. Hope springs eternal, she would have tried a call between the 3rd and fifth. Hence the phone was not under her control. from the 3rd to 5th. There are zero reasons to think that Kris or Lisanne were in control of anything, including whether they had their bras. panties, and shorts on, after 2pm 1st April 2014.",

The thought that someone kidnapped them, then allowed them to live for a week later create photos and then k***ing them, only then to have someone slowly kill off anyone that \"was involved\" over a year or so is too hard for me to reconcile - especially the thought of concocting different methods of removing the involved parties. I somewhat understand the appeal of wanting to find justice through these speculations, but I can't imagine this helps the family try to find peace.\n\nThank you for the documentary, as someone who has watched a lot on this case, I appreciated your approach and delivery.",

Hiking and fearing u are getting more & more lost, not getting closer to anything u recognize. Maybe the first few days they had some hope they would get through on their cell phones if they kept hiking, and then that hope slowly died as more days passed and they got hungrier and more tired. I think as u start starving and dying of thirst, u start hallucinating too, so that would make it even more scary in the jungle at night.   I think perhaps on that 7th day when they were taking the night photos, maybe they hiked up to a higher elevation to try to get a signal and they literally had no energy left at that point. They made an SOS sign w the ripped up map, put a mirror or some kind of refective surface down to try to refelect the camera flash, hoping helicopters were searching at night. And the little torn up bags on a twig was another way they were hoping it would catch someone's attention. I picture the blond girl injured, maybe she died first and the other girl didn't want to leave her, so maybe that was why her phone was trying to be unlocked without a pin. I picture them up on a cliff, their heads presses together crying, in complete darkness, so scared, hoping someone would find them. And imagine how horrible it would be if the one friend died first and then the other was left alone in the jungle 😔\n\nI pray for them & their families; this story is super facinating and tragic. ❤❤❤",

Like Juan quoted there was photoshoped pics in order to give a wrong track and confusing us. I do really believe that on this day the taxi driver brought the girls to the Caldera Hot Springs in Paja de Sombrero. It was a planned kidnapping for this day after Plinio and his guys do plan days before. The cropy picture with the two guys and girls are indicating for me that they have spent that day on that location. Then they got into the car and abducted for trafficking. Wealthy guys have paid for this and the taxi driver and thet two guys know the abducter/ perpetrator. Due the high media sensation and pressure the risk was high that it comes on the light, so they have decided to elimante all attendend who be a potential threat for that gang cartel. We should scope out the map and take focus on that potential area. I think we are close to solve the case. Cheers!",

Sadly, whoever planned and carried out this has been all too successful. The Panamanian authorities, however, seem more than happy to consign this case to history.

Either they got turned around and lost (which easily happens in the forest) or one or both of them got hurt in a fall or other accident. They tried to call for help but had no phone coverage. (April 1 around 4:40 PM). They probably decided to spend the night at some point and try again in the morning. They tried again periodically through April 4 when one phone died.  They possibly moved at one or more points ending up in the Culubre River basin. (Which would have provided a water source, but was not the area being searched). By April 8th when the photos were taken one could have been dead (or sick/hurt) and the other out of her mind in a panic. She was possibly trying to signal some noise she heard etc. At least one of them survived until April 11.",

Even if the murderer had the phone, he could have made Kris give him the correct PIN, so it makes me think she wasnt there. The thing is that the pictures that were taken at night were after April 6, and one of them\nshows Kris’ hair, so she must have been there to take this picture. Unless she was already dead and someone else took those photos. Everything about this is so scary.",

It really makes me think, we went thru so many of the same world events and social/cultural phenomenon together. Any memory I have, whether it's the release of Ocarina of Time on the N64 or the original Pokemon cards; good chance she would have had her own strong memories of it as well. We probably had the same memories of 9/11... sitting in class; maybe your teacher also watched with your class live as the planes hit the towers, broadcast on one of those CRT's on those portable stands they would keep them on. We would both have much clearer memories of every September 24 up until 2013; while for the vast majority of people it either held no significance or they weren't even born yet. I believe I have a very similar personality type to her as well; shy, sensitive, but craving for adventure, always pushing for personal growth and chasing after experiences as well as just having a deep-seeded need for love and connection on a human level. We were also both similar heights; I'm 188 and a half but she was 184; damn, that's tall for a woman! We also apparently graduated Uni the same year and with the same major. The year was 2014; her degree was more specific, I just got a major in Psychology. Thanks to that I know exactly what I was doing in March, April of 2014. Our Spring semester that year ended on April 4th, we had a 'reading-week' until the 8th and started final Exams on the 9th. So while Lisanne was taking those night photos, one of her last days on this earth, I know exactly where I was; I was at home, staying up all night as well cramming for my final I had put off until the last minute. By the time I was picking up my diploma she was already gone. Somehow, it makes me happy to have that very specific memory of where I was when this happened to her. It makes me feel a lot closer to her as a result. In the end, a bit upwards of 300,000 people were probably born on September, 24, 1991. I don't know how many are still alive, but Lisanne, you will always be in my memory and I'll make it to the finish line for the both of us.",

The photos are up are them trying to use the flash to get the planes attention. The items on the rock are the same.  Used so a search plane or helicopter would see it.  Thats why it is spread out like that.   This is also evidence that at least one of the girls was still alive 7 days later since they are still attempting to contact search parties.  As for 10:00 bone being bleached, natives from panama are not carrying bleach to try and bleach a pelvic bone.  Even the most competent drug dealer in the jungles of panama isn't going to go through the trouble to try and bleach a pelvic bone.  There has to be another conclusion to that.  GPS on the phones would show they didn't come back into town to \"party\".  The wrong password for Kris's phone is probably because Kris was gone and her friend was using her phone as her phone had died several days earlier.  The image at 6:28 is most likely her using the flash towards herself thinking it may highlight her to search crews, even if only for a second.  Its the same reason she took a picture of the branch with the orange bags tied to it.  She thought it may highlight it to planes.  After trying to flash the planes with no success, she thought maybe flashing it on the orange bag and rock may have a slightly higher chance of success.  Same with her flashing the white paper on the rock.  And I would bet same with Kris orange hair.  Lighting up orange hair with a flash was a signal attempt.  I would bet if flight logs could be reviewed, they would find an aircraft was visible to the girls location from 1:30-145 am.",

I also do wonder if part of the reason they went off the trail was because someone on it offered to be a guide. I imagine if the person asked not to be photographed they wouldn’t have found it odd in the moment. That or they didn’t want to have that person in their pictures. The one where one of the girls looks anxious makes me think of a situation where maybe one of the girls was getting suspicious and wanted to turn around but the other person and/or the other girl decided they would keep going. I could 100% see someone telling them that there is a cool place deeper in and that the would show them and then intentionally got them all lost and/or lead them to others who would aid in killing them.\n\nThe picture of Chris’s hair is what throws me the most. I genuinely wonder if it was taken as a trophy and she was scalped. It would make sense that the hair was dry if someone was keeping it in a backpack protected from the rain and I imagine it would have been washed before being tucked away to clean it up. It’s a gruesome theory and I do hope I’m wrong but I could shake the thought once I saw the picture.",

It was a 10 day cruise through the Western Caribbean. \n\nI can say the jungle in Panama is no joke because of all the wildlife, terrain and intense humidity as well. \n\nAll I can think, is that they were using the camera flash for vision and possibly to signal any planes flying over at night. Maybe the flash was to signal other people that had flashlights or were camping in the vast area. ?\n\nSomeone was obviously tampering with the I phone given the information you provided. \n\nAll the other evidence of bones being located 5 miles from the trail, but the remains found near a stream were with other people's bones,.....would make more sense if you follow the \"Bigfoot\" stories along the Appalachian Trail or Pacific Northwest. However, if animal attack evidence is not found, it seems like there's a serious killer out their in Panama who is a possible cannibal or has some sick agenda!? 🤔 \n\nThe photo of the blonde hair may have been taken by the girl's friend or the victim, to capture evidence of being injured!? People in sketchy situations tend to not use logic and get desperate for help, especially when lost in the wilderness or a jungle. \n\nThey are both attractive ladies, so that in itself is dangerous, \"Anywhere!\" People can be more dangerous than wildlife. 💯 😢\n\nHopefully a break in this case provides closure for the families and friends. 🙏 💔",

The connection of Kris and Lissane to the guide is that they booked him to take them on the trail they were killed on. He was in possession of information about their intention to walk that trail before they went on it. Is he supposed to have tipped someone else off who just happened to be the guys at the putative shack party who happened to know his son and invited him along. Taking the party scenario seriously, there were only two girls so why would they want a third or fourth guy for? There is not much zero evidence of Lisanne or Kris being the sort of girls open to such an invitation to party (ie consume alcohol) at a lonely spot with a gang of rough Panamanian men they hardly knew. It would be a very different thing to the brunch they attended that morning with two Dutch boys. There is the pool photo, but it was taken at a semi public spot. Kris and Lissane were not teenagers, they knew what young guys could be like. I think the shack party scenario is a calumny, but supposing they had went to such a party and stuff happened that caused them to expire.\n\nLet's say the after the party F is called in to cover up. This is presumably not an average Monday evening for him. Yet he does not just disappear the corpses, he  immediately also begins a longer term plan to create a false impression there was no crime. So without previously having ever so much as toyed with the idea of how to mount such a deception, and experiencing tremendous shock and stress, the fully formed and  fiendishly complicated scheme popped into his head when he put his mind on the problem there and then. Moreover, while under enormous unexpected pressure over the next 24 hours, he carries out all the highly involved maneuvers required while dealing with the police and keeping up a façade that would be difficult for someone with normal human feelings. He would be a very clever man.",

For the simple reason that accidents, not even cannibals delete photos. We all agree on a single suspect. Because all roads lead to Rome.\r\n  I have seen a video where a man shows the Pianist's Path, and it is very difficult to walk on it. The road at first is beautiful but then it turns into a horrible, dangerous and lonely road. At the end of the comment I will leave you the Link of the 2 videos that show the route of the Camino del Pianista. For you to draw your own conclusions. if they think it is possible for young women to travel alone. For my part, I don't think the girls could have gotten to the top of the pianist's path on their own, and as quickly as it seems they did, I think someone guided them. In the video I saw, it took a man 2 hours to get to the top of the trail. I ask who would dare to walk alone along a path of terror, without knowing the place? unattractive place. I think that when the young women walked around the place, at the time of the difficult and tiring trabecia they would have returned.\r\n\r\nI don't want to underestimate the intelligence of young girls. But precisely because of that faculty, I think they would have returned. I believe that no young woman of her age would walk that path alone, nor would an adult woman, without feeling fear and wanting to return. The truth is that the girls did not deserve such a horrible fate. I pray to God that the truth of what happened to them is known. I think the girls and their parents need this case cleared up. May the Lord enlighten your souls, And may they find rest.\r\n\nVideo 1 and 2\r\n \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gwhH0Gv-TE\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqIW0LTodgI",

I do not think that is really plausible, considering that if these guys abducted them then they would have immediately removed the phones from them, not say that they would be very careful not letting them use them at all!But... one thing that might support your theory is that the attempts to call the emergencies were once in a while and with different time periods and not very frequent. If I was somewhere on the woods and lost and panic, I would have tried repeatedly to call the emergencies and not just 1-2 times per day. Seems odd indeed!\n\n Also, even though the photograph sequence seems to be a very good theory, for them to be able to make it back after the trail, it seems unlikely that the panamanian authorities will think to change the order, and even if they did that would be easily proven by a third party authority....\n\nHowever, there are lots of gaps and inconsistencies on this case that is a mind-boggling story that even me I cannot explain...",

        "text": "Hi Doc, I watched both videos of this situation and I happen to agree with your theory... I noticed in the other videos they mentioned the photo of the one woman who looked a bit worried.. I believe they moved too far away from the trail and she was getting a bit worried but the other one wasn't. Kept encouraging her to take pics... Eventually, I think they both became scared when something or someone started stalking them both... They ran further into the woods.. and got further lost.. frantically calling 911 inbetween running and hiding... Perhaps they both did fall from something.. or got attacked by something.... their injuries were so severe the one woman could not focus much and frantically tried to call 911 from her friends phone... I think someone found them or their backpack and placed it where it could be found not wanting anything to do with what they discovered.. I think scavengers ate their bodies.. this is what I believe happend. It just doesn't really look like a criminal was involved.. too many 911 calls.. they wouldve taken their phones and camera!! and the money!! all found in the backpack. Also an animal couldve moved that backpack too playing with it. who knows..",

One could have gotten injured and soon died and the other girl stayed with her body and later died herself from the elements. I've seen deep storied of this like wrong passwords being entered on a phone and the random photos in the darkness, which I think after one died the other could have been trying to get into her phone and used a camera flash to get around in the dark. BUT... in saying that, the lack of bones found or clothes ect there was something fishy that happened. If they just died somewhere, their whole skeletons would be laying there and the clothes they were wearing at the time. This is what makes it such a mystery....",

The photos, although surreal, are not entirely indicative of anything untoward. Even the backpack could be explained if they were trapped. What is odd is the possibility of lime being used on the remains. And in particular the fact the bones were found in small pieces by locals who had gathered them up and kept them without notifying authorities.",

My opinion is that they got lost and the photos at night were trying to caught the attention of people they were hearing, at that time there were people looking for them in the jungle and also camping. Or maybe they were alucinating. They couldn’t see the lights because in the jungle the light goes straight to the dense vegetation and you are not able to see from far away any flash. It’s very sad and I hope that some day more rests can be found.",

        "text": "Went off route, because that just is what some pleople hyped about specifics tend to do.\nGot lost as heck. And called 112. Probably remained at spot for as long as they could trying not to even divert further in hopes to be found.\nShit got tight, when they figured day is approaching its end and used the mirror (way too late) to start a fire. This would be a natural human reaction in this situation to seeing the sun approach obstacles. Additionally this was the only stuff they had around as they left with pretty much nothing. A desperate attempt at making heat, light and a means to defend.\nUntil this point, it is probably the most likely thing to have happend considering their equipment, diaries and level of education. Especially the powering of the phones to preserve energy seems to me as a well calculated action.\nAfter that speculation begins.\nThe Night Photos were probably taken out of fear. Its the wilderness after all, whomever has seen a fullsize boar compared to an adult human will be able to understand this: if there were animal noises you would turn on the lights in europe. If you are in the wilderness and there are animal sounds YOU WILL use any means available to generate any sort of light source even if that means to take multiple shots with your camera. The pictures do show, that the only reason its showing the sky sometimes was the orientation of the phone. All Light is emitted in the same direction.\nIn this situation you would use light to confirm if any harm was done or is imminent.\nThe girls, fear induced by darkness and their surroundings which is absolutely understandable, decided to break camp at daybreak. No one is dumb enough to walk at night in such surroundings. They decided to use one phones battery before the others, which again is a smart survival action. That they did turn off the phones and only turned them on to try multiple rescue calls implies to me, that whatever happend them to die must have happend after them presumingly leaving the backpack by choice as it did only include stuff unneeded for survival which would have simply added additional weight to the shoulders of one of them both.\nIt is likely, from a human standpoint, that they tried to maintain direction of travel but mainly height in hopes to catch signal and went along the ridge at 8.913311933034283, -82.45466394407931. They probably followed that and made a lot of halts finding less steep terrain at 8.933576212448237, -82.44864498383144. Maybe they also took their first camp there April 1 to 2. Once they figured there is no signal to be gained the phase of realization of being lost kicks in followed by calming and the rationale to make a decision for progress. Water was probably not a limiting factor the first 1-3 days as it rained and the area provided ampt amounts of foilage to be used as rain catchers for the bottles. From here they could have made the decision to follow the flat terrain towards the NW towards 8.94815491630155, -82.46768512864843 OR towards the East in direction of 8.918629461068516, -82.4153147082269. Its programmed into people to follow slopes and draws until you find the lowest terrain feature and hopefully a river. Rivers do provide \"fresh\" water, occaisions of food and usually lead towards civilization when followed down stream. But both knew that they came from upstream as the continantal devide is a widely recognizable feature from the wide riverbed, once they found the river they probably realized, that they were on the wrong side of the devide and went upstream towards 8.897815180967918, -82.40558468904538. Somewhere there one or both of them probably lost their lifes heading into the right direction.\nThe only reason for death I can Imagine is the unfortunate case of Lisanne having a physically traumatic incident, a fall of great height of sorts.\nThe fact, that the check for signal maintained constant and the backpack was nearly undamaged makes a return for retrieval unlikely.\nWhich leaves the point, that the incident, injury or murder of both must have happend upstream into south direction.\nBoth are part of about 20 people that disappeared in that area over the years around 2013. Chalk and fertilizer being used to disintegrate the remains and their spreading across the riverside makes it very likely, that they and others are victims of either someone wanting to dispose of the hikers bodies quietly after finding both dead after and incident for staying undercover (most likely drug and man trafficing taking place and the fear of routes or camps being detectred when large search parties maintained) or flat out murder which would make no sense, as they had no belongings on them that would be of any major worth.",

        "text": "This seems fairly simple to me. First, the girls (being Dutch) weren't used to this sort of landscape. They went on the hike and either didn't know to turn back or they decided to purposefully continue on. There are reported smaller trails just used by locals that connect to the one they were on. I suspect they decided to continue. Then, they walked for three hours, getting lost as they started to lose the path. Then, Kris falls in some way. I suspect it was on a river bank as they were trying to follow the river bed. She has a major injury (likely the broken pelvis) and potentially a blow to the back of her head (showing her hair in the one photo and it looks like at the very bottom potentially a blow) and this is when they start calling 112 (emergency services for Dutch). This is them calling because it wouldn't be the number someone else tries in this region. Then, they try multiple times calling 112 and 911 over the next couple of days. Dense jungle prevents them from getting through. Lisa's phone dies first even though they attempt to save the batteries. Meanwhile, Kris is really hurt and in a lot of pain. The majority of calling is done by Lisa from her phone. Unfortunately, Kris dies sometime on April 3rd or 4th. Lisa's phone has no battery left after the 4th. She starts trying to use Kris's phone, but doesn't have the pin code. She tries entering multiple pins she thinks Kris might have used. Kris was badly hurt and never got to tell her the pin. Perhaps even...if she did have a head blow...wasn't fully coherent. So that is why there are multiple attempts with the wrong pin. Then I think it's likely Lisa tries to walk out after Kris dies...knowing it is her only hope. She might have even tried to walk to high ground to attempt to get a cell phone signal. At one point, she uses the camera flash for lighting and that's why we see odd pictures. Unfortunately, on April 11th, Lisa dies. She turned on Kris's iPhone and had it on for an hour attempting to find signal. She probably hoped she could make an emergency call even without the pin. But, she turns it off after an hour with 22% battery remaining. She never turns it on again, suggesting she doesn't make it another night. Likely she was either injured or died from exposure/thirst/hunger. If not, with 22% left she likely would have tried again. \n\nThe foul play idea is ridiculous. What captors would let them keep their cell phones? And what captors would be smart enough to try 112 or 911 instead of the local emergency numbers? Also, why even bother trying to fake anything? \n\nThey found the backpack and bones spread out because Lisa kept going...trying to find a way out. Kris had already died and she didn't know what to do.",

Après c'est vrai que les photos sont étranges. \nQuelle tristesse de voir de jeunes femmes qui avaient encore toute leur vie devant elles et plein de rêves meurent de manière certainement lente et douloureuse, lors d'un voyage qui était censé être un magnifique souvenir qu'elles ont entre elles.\n\nTon contenu est vraiment fabuleux, je te suivais avant ton changement de contenu et je trouve que tu as bien fait, on voit que tu aimes ce que tu fais et de la qualité de tes vidéos. Je ne regarde pas souvent parce que c'est vrai que je fais beaucoup attention à mes énergies et c'est vrai que je me sens impactée au bout d'un moment lorsque en regardant du True Crime, donc j'évite mais j'aime bien regardé de temps en temps, surtout que tu expliques super bien. \n\nMerci à toi,\nOlive u <3",

They wouldn’t have left the trail unless something or someone frightened them off of it. They left a note on that tag. It says “They”. And it was placed next to twigs tipped with red flags made out of red biohazard bags almost shaped like two trails. What were they trying to say? Why were THREE other bodies found near their remains? It doesn’t add up. The photo next to the hair looks like a skull, and in one, there appears to be a figure.\n\nPanamanian law enforcement is very corrupt. I’m from Panama. \n\nIn that very area another hiker tourist was actually kidnapped and held in a shack and sexually assaulted by (I think local guides) but she escaped by defending herself with a broken bottle and ran away.\n\nSomeone left that back pack on purpose to suggest they got lost. They may have gotten lost but they were in the least driven off the trail OR someone attacked them. They knew not to leave the trail. They weren’t stupid.\n\nOne of the girls actually wrote in her diary that the tour guide gave her the creeps. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that whoever knew the area knew there was no phone service and could have made the calls to make it seem they were lost the whole time.",

That would also explain what the medical examiner said about the foot being broken from a fall... they were running from someone and most likely fell down a hill. The reason they were turning their phones off in between calls was to save power. My theory was that they knew they were being hunted and that maybe the person was just toying with them at that point. But after the 911 calls ceased the killer snapped photos of random things to throw the authorities off. After basically pulverizing them considering theres no scratches on the bones as if an animal got to them, the killer most likely cleaned the backpack and items, kept their skulls and other certain items as trophies and planted the backpack on the bank. Murder is the only explanation for their mysterious death.",

Why would he bother to delete one photo from the camera but leave all the other images intact? Why would he not dispose of all their belongings, which would have been very easy to do in the jungle, instead of leaving them somewhere for the police to find? If they were kidnapped and had access to their phones, surely they would have kept some record of the events or sent messages to their family, etc. It is all deeply mysterious and tragic, but the murder scenario has some serious flaws in it.",

I say 100% they are hiding something and Filiciano thinks that being in the centre of attention actually rules him out as a suspect and I feel his is so confident about not getting caught as he is part of a large network of criminal activity some of it also known and run in very high places their. \n\nalso the fact the taxi driver died in strange way makes my think there's a connection there as well.",

The girls decided to go alone to the pianist trail after having breakfast in a restaurant (There are photos where they can be seen having breakfast and looking at a map). The next day Feliciano with his Spanish classmate waited for them at the Spanish school, they had met at 8 am but they did not appear.

That being said, it does seem like a good place to turn around if you're hiking on this trail. a sudden change in scenery from the enclosed walls of rock and thick shrubbery from where they came.\r\n\r\nedit: it's worth mentioning in 508 you can see Kris facing back across the stream, and behind her seems to be an incline of the trail leading up. if you watch the video, you'll see this is an illusion, as what appears to be a path behind her is not part of the trail. instead, the path continues much more horizontally to the right of her as she faces the camera.\r\n\r\nAs the trail continues past the stream, there are several places that \"could\" potentially cause one to get lost, but i wouldn't say it's likely. There are several forks that veer off, and appear as though they could be part of the trail if you were an unexperienced hiker and weren't paying attention. while i don't think they are pronounced enough to cause any real confusion, if you were to veer off the trail in those surroundings, it would be easy to lose your bearings. I don't think that's what happened, but it's not entirely impossible that they could have gotten lost on one of these offshoots.",

I was thinking they were using the camera flash to navigate the woods... kinda like a flash light, but in strobe form - take a picture to get a view of Ur surroundings, then pick a way forward. Trying to get their bearings, and not fall into holes and such. Probably only taking a picture if they sensed obstacles in their path. The girls may also have taken pictures of candy wrappers and liter they left so that they could retrace their steps if they chose to turn around... something their attacker probably dismantled, so the girls would stay lost. The last picture was probably taken of the person who attacked them... and their attacker took the camera to a computer and deleted the photo of them. Caught them approaching, or hiding behind a tree, or something. Their attacker probably took their back packs from the girls before they got lost... the girls probably abandoned their bags running from a creeper following them, and the creeper noted where the bags were, then followed the girls, who just had their camera and phones. Their creeper probably eventually attacked the girls, killing them, then brought the girls' bodies somewhere, and then retrieved the backpacks... then stripped the girls' bodies with acid, or let them decay, then busted the bones into manageable pieces, then stuffed the bones in something and brought the bones to where they were found. Then set the backpacks there with the phones and the camera, so people would think the girls remains had been ravaged by animals after the girls got lost. Or their killer wanted to taunt police with the backpacks and phones, and the scene was intentionally made to be obviously staged. The other bones were other victims, disposed of at the same time... to go unnoticed as extra bones, or to taunt police with other victims. I'm surprised the police consider the girls to have died of national causes... the situation looks man made, and cruel.",

Both were insured either by the jungle or their attacker and later found dead. The people finding the remains tried to speed up the decomposition process by using lime so the remains could be scattered easily through the forest. The backpack was first kept by someone to hide it and later brought to the authorities to steer the investigation in a certain direction. \nI'm a traveler myself. This case is keeping me up at night.

        "text": "In another video, the parents of Kris Kremers took the same trail to get an idea of the terrain the young women faced months earlier. They stated that there could have been no way for the ladies to have gotten lost because thick vegetation surrounds the trail on both sides. However, I think they did not factor in the following: 1) They retraced their daughter's steps already knowing the outcome. Hindsight is always viewed with 20/20 glasses; 2) The parents had guides with them and could have never gotten lost, whereas Kris and Lisanne were unguided and unfamiliar with the area; 3) Having hiked countless trails in many countries (including tropical ones) myself, there is always the main trail but animal trails and washes that look like trails, many single-track and narrow, are always present. It would be easy for inattentive newbies talking and snapping photos to start walking along one of these by mistake; 4) Kris's parents took a day trip and brought the necessary gear and supplies, but as we know based on the calls that were made on Kris and Lisanne's phones, that the two were out there for days with insufficient food and clothing. People have commented that they could have simply walked out. Seemed like Kris had gotten injured and Lisanne could not, or did not want, to leave her. With each passing day, the lack of food and exposure to the elements would have taken a toll on them mentally and physically. Other thoughts: Why did they take night shots of seemingly random things? Jungles come alive at night. I'd be doing the same thing if there were things moving around and making sounds in the darkness. Why did they call 112 (the equivalent of 911) in the Netherlands? My guess is because it was familiar to them. They had not been in Panama for very long after all and would have known that calling their homeland's emergency agency would have been more reliable than calling the hostel where they were staying. The Dutch responders would have immediately known to contact their parents to make them aware of the situation. Of course the rest of this tragic story raises more questions than answers and has many parts, but this is just my take about one of those parts.",

Bag one place, bones upstream, only  small bones found scattered, no skulls found, electronics in cheap backpack undamaged after 2 months in river, half charged iPhone turning on on 11thday, deleting  photo#509 completely all point to crime. The fact that they didn't redail emergency after the call disconnected after 2 seconds confirms third party. If natural causes prevented from Redailing it would also prevent from switching off. The fact that phone switched off within 30 secs after disconnected is done by third person. So by that time either crime was done or in progress. From there it's the detectives job to put together which they failed or concealed from public",

Everybody is obsessed with that theory and its understandable. More often than not when young girls vanish, foul play is usually the reason but not this time. It was not wise for them to go off by themselves to explore that area. They should have gone in a group or at least with someone who was familiar with the terrain. They went too far out and got lost or perhaps they had even gotten hurt and weren't capable of making it back but if the situation had been handled better they could have been rescued. Very sad and those night pictures are eerie and i do think her friend was dead in that one picture and she was all alone in the pitch darkness and no doubt terrified and starving and I'm sure she figured she wasn't going to make it out of there alive either so she was just waiting to die or by some miracle be rescued. As a volcanologist, I know all about frightening situations so I can imagine what they went through and for two young woman who sadly perished while simply trying to live life to the fullest, its a terrible shame. Unfortunately what happened to them happens quite often to hikers who go off exploring areas like that.  They weren't the first ones and i hate to say but they won't be the last. At least something of them was found. Many people who go hiking in rough terrain like that seemingly vanish into thin air and no trace of them is ever found. Foul play was not the issue in this case though I'm convinced and there's absolutely no evidence to support that theory. All those attempts to phone for help and those night time pictures being taken 10 days after they disappeared proves they were still out there and alive and that one guy was right. If they were murdered,  the killer would not have left their stuff out there to be found especially a cameras full of photographs.",

I count myself among them and can look anyone in the eye without blinking and say “These videos are one of three things: \n•a confession from someone directly involved in the case itself. Not the investigation. The crime. \n•a testimony from a whistle blower who matches the above description but is one degree removed from the crimes \n•speculative faction (fiction within factual parameters) so sharp this individual should be writing in Hollywood making $2-$3 mil a year.” \n\nJoe if you read this please understand that as we close in on year two since you posted part two there are thousands and thousands of us who’ve read Scarlet’s blog multiple times and watched dozens of hours of Juan Parea Monsuwe’s photo analysis and we are turning mad circles knowing that you have a bead on this case that we cannot find. Shit many are speculating you may no longer be among us. I pray that isn’t the case.",

The backpack demonstrates: Climb carried by Lisane, downhill Kris\n2-Feliciano probably is covering the murder in which his son was involved\n3-Omar was going to confess to get the reward, and the gang killled him, maybe Feliciano was also there.\n4-Feliciano were into the set up of the backpack, bones, etc.\n5-Panama Goverment went for the official version in order not to lose tourism\n6-Photos were manipulated for the public, probably in 509 the girls were getting the restaurant El Pianista or getting into the red van\n7-Still inside someone's house there's clothes from the girls.\n8-Feliciano told he never spoke to the girls, but on Wednesday told to Elise that the girls didn't speak Spanish, how the hell he could know? \n9-Kris was an Angel, pretty, and that young guys never saw such a beauty, put a party, drugs and alcohol...I bet something happens, and all went wrong during 1st April night\n10-Fist 911 call was made where the girl noticed they're kidnapped, into some place.\n11-Emergency calls probably were done after an alarm, due the same time frame all days.\n12-The 80 night pictures were also a setup, That's not Kris real hair\n13-If you want to find real clues, go there without Feliciano\n14- Alto Romero citizens will talk more if you pay well, simple. There're contradictions between the allocation of the backpack founding.\n\nDuring 1 month I've been changing my mind several times, if you check my channel I was wondering about the antenna coverage, but today, I bet still there're complete skeletons awaiting to be founded ovethere, into Feliciano's properties around Alto Romero. Also will be fine to register his home.",

With most cold cases, you can at least sorta guess what happened to someone such as if someone last spoke to some weird person then yeah that weird person probably had something to do with it.\n\nBut this whole entire case… geez you just really don’t know what the hell happened. The fact that they only called the emergency number ONE TIME, the photos during the night, the path they took being practically impossible to get lost in etc… nothing just makes sense. And what sucks is that there’s no concrete evidence to support a theory, I mean it’s all just up for grabs by this point. Did they get lost and ultimately died with their bodies not found? Did they get murdered? Did they get kidnapped? Did they purposely kill themselves or get lost?",

Everyone knows that is what you should do (especially in a foreign country's jungle) as you risk getting lost even more and help having trouble to find you. I know call didn't go through, but naturally people notice you being gone and they would start looking. Or other hikers are likely to be heard in a distance. Just sit it out for a day or two or five, wandering off is far worse. You burn energy and get more vulnerable. I don't think they were killed (because of day 8 photos), but I believe something or someone forced/scared them deeper into the jungle. Also the tour guide is sus, we can't deny that.",

Interesting story, but I guess this sends out a clear warning to those who are keen on hiking, camping or going out into the wilderness. The woods are dangerous, just because they are devoid of wild animals and are frequently visited by other foreigners/natives does not mean they are completely safe. A lot of sickos are out there, for all we know someone could've jumped out of a bush killed them took the photos scattered their remains and dipped. Cold and intriguing case, thank you for shedding light on it, Unpredictable. RIP to the girls",

I know it seems stupid to go off the trail, but coming from rural parts of the US and being near national parks, you hear stuff like this all the time, especially from European tourists doing dumb stuff like trying to get close to the edge of cliffs for a photo or trying to pet deer/bison/bears. There’s no doubt in my mind they would make what seems like irrational choices to us sitting on the couch, but especially once they were in trouble and panicked was for them all they could think to do.

Und den Schreien im Dschungel, die ein anderer Tourist hörte, die ihn in Panik versetzt hatten ...so dass er sofort zurücklief. Bei einem Unfall hätte man schon  ( leider) am Zweiten Tag  die Körper der Mädchen gefunden, ob verletzt  oder schwerst verletzt. Selbst wenn nur ein Mädchen verletzt  gewesen wäre, hätte die Freundin Hilfe holen  können. Diese gesamte konstruierte Geschichte  ist alles andere als glaubwürdig.  Selbst der  weitergehende Pfad  hinter dem Pianista  geht nur  in eine Richtung nach vorne  oder wieder  zurück nach Boquette.  Und zuletzt werden nur noch \" kleine Knochen\" gefunden....wie schnell verwesen Leichen im Urwald? Blanke Beckenknochen nach 3 bis 4 Monaten? Was sagen denn Pathologen  und Forensiker dazu?  Und welche wilden Raubtiere  treten nur nachts  in Erscheinung und tagsüber  gibt es sie nicht? Es gibt doch keine Warnhinweise in Bezug auf Raubtiere bei der Beschreibung des El Pianista Weges. Natürlich haben die Eltern nicht mehr die Kraft der Wahren Ursache auf den Grund zu gehen.  Die Mädchen sind in ihr Unglück gelaufen. Niemals hätten sie alleine die Wanderung unternehmen dürfen.",

One of the last photos taken has been forensically modified to help brighten the picture. You can see a large cat. The girl was smart to create as much of a reflective surface as possible to temporarily flash-blind the jaguar. From the summit point, one of the young women saw how easy it would be to travel along the river all the way to the north coast, rather than turn around. The girl in this picture was really uncomfortable with the idea of following the riverbank. She probably countered her friend’s proposition with “If the path was meant to go further, someone would have done it many times already, and there would be a clear path.” A jaguar's main hunting area is the riverbank. Jaguars have one of the highest bite strengths of any animal. When a cat chews bone, it grinds it into a paste. The only bones left with mountain lion attacks tend to be the flesh they couldn’t get out of the footwear.",

But why have those not been made any better? Simply: They knew the real reasons of their deaths and it was an accident and they had to cover it. Think about it. \nManipulating the camera would have been easy, but manipulating the phones would not. It takes a highly paid expert to do this, so they omitted it. Also with the other belongings. Insted of wearing the backpack out, they took it right from the repository and also the foot because they kept him because he identifies one of the women. They took the bones right from the graveyard, where they still are, to misslead us here.\nBut where have the women been in those seven days. They have not felt distressed because  of the only few attempts to make contact. I also believe that elements of the dayfotos must have been taken during this time. In my opinion all camera-photos during this time had been erased. Equally messy because it had to be cheap and quick and executable by one or two loyal people.\nIs there a place where you can go with two women without they becoming suspicious for six or seven days? A place without mobilconnection but with locations worthy of two thumbs up? And if they would have to flee, because they want to work from the seventh or eight on, a location where they could have had an accident together at the same time or get lost? For me the phones indicates that they must have been alive. But where?",

They tried to by spreading apart the girl's items and body parts. Very naïve for anyone to think this was just an accident. Lots of people get killed here and locals know by whom but they can't do anything against the gangs. There are also a some locals who have relation to gang because they have relatives in gang. The Panamanian government is complicit in all of this. They know what happened but will not admit it because it will make Panama look bad.",

Nights in a jungle for a city girl with no experience can be a near death experience, explaining those sudden photos to push away the Nights terror in vain.  When you are frightened, you do all sorts of irrational behaviour desperately calling emergency services.  She too finally succumbed to her death or might even bumped into wrong people but personally I think TERROR itself overcame her decision making ability, resulting in her death. Intruders will go through your stuff, take your phone or break it and won't definitely call emergency services",

It just gives good indication that 3rd party was not involved.\n2) Once again assuming it was 3rd party, then why would someone delete camera picture to cover tracks, but left iphone(77 tries) intact that could potentially had pictures of perpetrstor(s) as well? When in panic, its so much easier to do picture with phone than with huge camera(my opinion).\n3)are any of the parents trying to fight over what happened to 509? I understand they want to move on with life, but my hypothesis is that the photo was deleted per parents request.\n\nWhat baffles me is what they did the first night in the jungle. How come there are no pictures or notes on 1st night? I somehow cant believe that 8th night alone in woods is scarier than 1st.",

        "text": "This to me sounds like an accident and not a crime. Due to the following points.\nThe girls were so happy and excited about the trip and they seem to be really enjoying it in the early images. \nThey had so much energy left at the spot were they should have ended the trip, So, they felt confident enough to continue the journey a bit more. \nKris seems to have lost energy or started to worry. Explaining the less happy face in the later images. \nThe deleted image might be them deleting a blurry photo or accidentally hitting delete.\nThey are now lost in the jungle, two city girls from another culture, in a different topography and weather.\nThe bras...it's and isolated space, they had privacy or they just weren't the mood to deal with the heat and exhaustion so, girls being girls they took it off and carefully placed it in the bag neatly folded. Or the lady who found it opened it and once realising it might not just be a lost bag, placed everything back carefully and contacted authority.\nOnce they found that they are lost, they tried to save battery and used the phones for emergency calls only. \nKris definitely seems to be the one to have passed first and Lisa was the one who tried to unlock Kris's phone to keep getting help. She might not have known or noticed that she could place emergency calls from the lock screen.\nThe images took at night is what really make me sad and scared. In my opinion it was Lisa next to Kris's body, in the middle of a jungle, all alone in dark, probably super week,dazed, and scared. just trying to get some light cause she was scared or heard something in the bushes. We don't know how fast the shutter was pressed. They didn't turn it on before so there's a good possibility that she used it for light since the phones are dead now. Or she was just trying to signal someone thinking there would be search parties up for them by now. Or she just documented the location by randomly taking pictures in all direction.\n\nThe body parts might be the jungle dealing with their dead bodies. Wild animals and the extreme weather conditions plus their super weak and already decomposing bodies...\nif the leg got caught in between rocks in a strong flowing river the weak body will be ripped clear off leaving the shoes and foot behind.\n\n\nTo me 95% it was an accident. But, 5%...\nWhy they never made another call or SMS. (They might have been certain it would be a waste of energy)\nWhy they didn't bother taking pictures after they were sure they are lost ( They might have been too worried or not in a mental state to do it.)\nLisa seems to have recorded some vlog type video or greetings for someone, earlier. So she is definitely the type to have recorded herself in the camera documenting her current state or last moments. But she did not do it. No images of their then current situation or her deceased friend or anything is daylight.... So the images available on the camera was her definitely trying to see something in the dark, scared. I don't see any probability of someone else ever coming into contact with them.\nThe bag was dry... but how long was it with that lady who found it. How strong was the sun that day. What kind of fabric it had....\n\nAnyway this is just heartbreaking. Pls, pls, if you ever go on an adventure like this...be aware of your skills and surroundings. Be aware of all things that could go wrong and prepare accordingly.",

These \"maybes\" are used so often that it is hard to see which things are just speculation, and which are truth with some real indications to what happened. And the Reddits are pretty ridiculous, especially the \"....continue to kill again\" entry. \n\nThe good info: let's assume he met them and knew they wanted to hike that area; and that they left without him (was he supposed to go with them or was he taking them to his ranch?) the day prior, it's a little odd he decided to go find them at their hostel, unless he was truly concerned that they were missing from their hike. Then, he reported them missing immediately? That seems odd because why would someone on vacation immediately be considered missing, by a stranger? Big assumption, even if just trying to be helpful. \n\nBut if he had something to do with it, why would he go search for them? And why report anything? Sure, I get the \"throw the sent off by trying to help\", that has happened in other cases you'd read about. Unless he is worried about physical evidence, and decided to place himself in their room so that there is a reason for him to have been there (even though it seems physical evidence against the guide are lacking, and nothing was collected by investigators). \n\nHowever, he had a reason to be there, if he 1) supposedly had an appt with them, and 2) once they are missing, if he is an \"authority\" on the trails, then it is proper for him to assist the search. \n\nOne of the stranger things not discussed much, if connected, (aside from the murder of the girls) is the cab driver being killed. Would he have known something? This is the strangest story. The photos make no sense. So much of it makes no sense.",

They went past the designated trail, feeling confident with their experience hiking in Northern Europe and not realizing how dangerous what they were doing was. Got lost, and did their best to preserve battery life of their devices. It only takes a day or two to become completely dehydrated and delirious. After a week, they’re not in their right mind or thinking rationally. They’re doing whatever they can to survive another minute. The final photos is them making sense of their environment/sending out a last call for help with 0 energy left. They were totally & completely depleted of energy AND possibly severely injured at this point. They also disappeared/were found in an environment where the body would naturally decompose very quickly and become “bleached” just from exposure to the elements. I think foul play is the absolute LEAST likely scenario here.",

That could further go along with what the authorities said happened. I think they may have found somewhere to protect them from rain, injured, and passed cause they couldn’t get anywhere. I also believe that it could have been some kind of foul play because who would go farther than the Mirador in a foreign country, no supplies, leave the trail to climb over rocks by a river through thick forest. I kind of wonder if someone guided them somewhere off trail and just left them. Maybe one got injured and the other stayed with her cause the one who was guiding them said they’d go to get help but freaked out and didn’t, just leaving them there waiting for rescue that wouldn’t come. Anything is possible.",

This river is a bit larger than the one seen in the last day photo with Chris, and offers possibilities of taking a refreshing bath/swim. I think the girls \"adventured\" down this river to take a swim - that is why they put their bra, sunglasses, phones etc. in the backpack. I don't think they went very far down this river, not at all. I think their plan was to take a short swim and then start walking back to the summit and then back to Boquete. But then something happened (at around 4PM) while they were taking the swim. An accident to one of them? This is very likely. Or an assault? Also not impossible. In either cases I believe that they were not lost, they were not too far from the crossing of the path with this 3rd river. The noise of the river is very loud. I believe that the search teams would not have heard them screaming, especially if they would have walked a bit further off-track along the river. You can see this river and hear the noise here (at min: 9:20):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8AI3M1heAY&t=646s This is also the river reached by the girl's parents. The parents say that this river is consistent with the time of the 1st emergency call. In the blog of Romain C (https://imperfectplan.com/2021/11/21/panama-expedition-2021-complete-overview/) you can read more about river #3. The fact that the girls removed their bra and put them in the backpack is very consistent with taking a swim. The fact that the girls did not wear the bra anymore points to the possibility that this was either not possible anymore, or not at all a priority. This is in my opinion an extremely important clue. Something happens while they are taking a swim, probably either naked, or only partially naked. What happened exactly? Why none of them bothered wearing the bra's again? Yet, apparently, they made multiple attempts to call. And Chris's shorts were found, but none of her remains with the shorts. Did she take off the shirts before swimming? Very likely. But why she did not put them on again after the accident?",

A tribe living in the jungle could explain why they had no interest in the money or electronics. They simply had no use for them. Also heavy rain ..but the picture with the blonde hair of one of the girls is dry. I can't see the injury either on that picture but it seems like there might be some blood in her hair. They were under some big rocks so one would assume there was a small cave or something that they used as shelter from the rain, explaining why her hair was dry. \n\nMaybe they didn't turn back because they were chased by someone. That local guide was kinda sus. This would explain why they simply didn't turn back and went back the same way they got to the point where they ended up. \n\nIt is interesting that they didn't left a message. If I'd have my phone I would at least leave a note in it especially after so many days and little hope. Maybe it wouldn't be the first thing I think about but after so many days If there were two of us and the other person would be injured or dead I'm sure I'd take pictures of the injury or the body and what happened. All we have is pictures of rocks and vegetations and rain. Why?!\n\nThey could have been lost or chased for days then found and killed in some way. Someone had to delete the missing photo and according to the reports it must have been done with a computer because they couldn't restore the deleted picture. Maybe the local police made this mistake and kept their mouth shut adding to the mystery.",

        "text": "Yeah, blame the jungles. It doesn't make any sense at all. First of all, where are the bodies? Even if they fell from some sort of cliff you'll still have the bodies, at least the majority of the bodies would be intact. Eaten by animals? The fragments didn't show signs of that. And still, bones will be still found if the bodies were eaten by animals. Secondly, why they took off their bras and put them in the backpack? if they were lost or had an accident, they wouldn't have organized their belongings in such a neat fashion. It seems \"put together\" by someone. Thirdly, the trail is only a few kilometers long, and the area surrounding it isn't vastly big, plus there are trails all over and human activities are not scarce. With all the search efforts no large bodily remains nor other signs(made by them, the attempts to get help, the branch with red plastic bags, etc.). Fourthly, the missing/deleted picture from the camera. This didn't get mentioned in this video but there was one picture was deleted. Later a picture of the same day in the same area was posted on a website. It shows two girls with two guys taking a dip in the water. Although inconclusive the girls' body shaps resemble our missing girls. And the two guys in the picture both died within 2 years. Fifthly, they've only attempted to call the \"emergency number\" for days. This doesn't make sense. On the surface level, you'd think that's the right move but think again. After trying and trying they hadn't thought about calling someone else? If calling doesn't work wouldn't you try to send text messages? The phones with all those \"112\" attempts could be deliberately made to make you think they had an accident and tried to call for help, but it's just too stupid to believe. \nJust search \"Panama ritual dead bodies\". You don't' believe people can carry out sinister acts? It's all conspiracies? Think again. Humans are capable of all evil acts. Blame the corrupt & incompetent authorities? yeah, they are. Also, it could be a perfect excuse for \"unsolved cases\". In my opinion, the guide they've contacted last had something to do with it or at least knows something about it. And their host advised them against hike that trail the night before and sent a dog with them the next day, the dog went back alone that evening. And the dog didn't appear in any of those photos. Nothing adds up in this case. The official verdict just doesn't make any sense and makes it even more questionable.",

The photos taken show me a rough sketch of a story. They were walking at night, came across a cliff, and the one holding the camera fell. The bunch of pictures of blackness? That's the sky. But. Someone took those pictures and actually overlaid them. They are all of the same patch of sky, just all slightly angled differently.  That, to me, looks like someone on the ground, using the camera flash over and over, trying to get found by the other girl. \n\nAll of their remains were found downstream from a big waterfall. The bone bleaching and phosphorus can be explained easily by insects. They don't eat bones, but they would essentially strip the flesh off of bone pretty efficiently.",

        "text": "I don't think most of the 'theories' surrounding this case are realistic, whether it's Feliciano and his gang of roving bandits abducting the girls on the trail or the idea that they just walked nearly 6 hours north in the hopes that the trail would loop around before realizing it was about to get dark. I much rather just put myself in Lisanne's head, whom I believe was generally the one organizing their expedition, and go off of what we know about the girls actions leading up to the hike to make a logical guess about what probably actually happened. I think both Kris and Lisanne were anxious and restless after being rejected from the teaching job at the school, unsure of what they will be doing the next weeks in Boquette. They partially solved this issue by going to their host, which gave them a number of other suggestions for volunteer work. They also went to the tour guide, Feliciano, to set up a date for a hike. This is them acting responsibly and was clearly the correct way to do things. Clearly they were still feeling impatient on Tuesday; Lisanne specifically mentioned being homesick in her journal and feeling like she wasn't fit to take care of things on her own. I think that the April 1st hike started as a relatively short and relaxing way to get their mind off of things, but at some point it also became about proving to themselves how capable they are. The fact they brought barely any water and that they didn't tell anyone where they were going is actually a lot worse than people seem to make it out to be, though it would likely not have fatal consequences if they just stuck to their original plan. What do I think happened after they crossed the summit? I think they were looking for something off the trail like perhaps a waterfall or a crossing to another trail. Who knows what they read online or where they were getting their information from. It's pretty evident they didn't feel like they needed anyone else's help or input, preferring to just navigate the area on their own without telling someone their plans.  It's the only thing that really fits with the timeline and the orientation of the emergency calls. There's nearly 3 hour unaccounted for from the last photo to first emergency call and if I was doing something stupid with a high probability of getting me lost on a fairly straight forward trail in broad daylight it would be intentionally walking down an area that I'm pretty sure was the path I read about online which leads to something cool.",

        "text": "I looked up that there is a side trail from the Main Pianista Trail to hidden waterfalls on Pipeline Trail, which is a quick hike from Pianista. Of course internet in 2014 wasn’t near as good as today. I think maybe they could have gotten confused along their hike. After they had reached the Mirador, maybe thought the trail beyond would take them to the hidden waterfalls. From what I found on internet that is possible with an experienced guide on a detour trail. So they’d have to leave the main trail for a side trail. The last daytime photo of Kris standing on rock in stream looks like she was in deep thought and why she wasn’t smiling. Maybe the girls turned back up the trail and went off that main trail to a side trail thinking it would lead them to hidden waterfalls along Pipeline. Maybe it was adventurous for them to discover the hidden waterfalls going from a Pianista Route instead of just taking a Taxi to Pipeline Trail. Maybe they wanted to do both trails in one day. That could explain leaving the main trail, after the continental divide. Anything could have happened after that mistake. It’s just my opinion. My thoughts on why they would leave the trail at all.",

I think Kremers (the lone girl in the later photos) was killed long after the first was killed. Kremers then escaped with the stuff and was killed later.  The bones were picked clean by ants (no bleach involved and no tissue would be left). You can not get away from ants in Panamá. The women were inexperienced but there is no doubt they were murdered unless you ignore some of the evidence. The killer(s) was/were (a) serial killer(s). There were three indigenous women known to have been killed in the area earlier. That kind of killer very often keeps trophies. Later the trophies, the backpack, the shoe with foot still in it and the shorts were dispersed because of the police involvement. Sorry Doctor, in this case your extreme effort to be balanced and your unfamiliarty with the area misled you. I know you are not familiar with the area because you mispronounced Boquete.",

One of them broke a foot the other one walked to find help. 2 days being immobile with no food or water in the jungle is basically death. The surviving girl got lost too. She tried contacting authorities via her friend’s phone but didn’t know the lock code. She took photos in the dark so that she can find her way back to her friend. 2 months after the death, an animal finds the pelvic bone and eats it clean. Just my theory.",

        "text": "11:28 That's not reddish-blonde hair. That's thin blonde hair over pinkish skin. If you look at the pictures of the girls, the one with blonde hair has thin hair, you can see it from her part-- thicker hair has more volume, and you don't usually see that much of the scalp unless it's done super neatly.\n\nThere's bloom in the shot-- look at the way the color of her hair bleeds into the background. That piece of reddened hair is just a result of camera artfacting, reflecting her skin into the hair.\n\nWhich leads me to believe this is a photo of the back of her head. It's super tangled, probably because she hadn't tied it back (they weren't expecting to be out there long.)\n\nBut the thing that raises red flags for me is that stray brown hair in the image. That's not a camera quirk, that's definitely hair. But why would her hair be angled like that? Reaching towards her friend? I have long brown hair, this really only happens if you're taking an image of something below you and your hair ends up dangling in the shot.\n\nThen there's the way her hair is resting. You can see her forelock angled out, really all of her hair fanning out, but as you can see from the rest of the images, her hair isn't styled, it's flat. The only way I could see it appearing this way, if it really is the back of her head, is if she were laying down with her face in the dirt, and her friend (or someone else with longer brow hair,) is taking the picture while standing over her.",

The photos being randomly taken could probably be them trying to run away, maybe they were trying to see what was chasing them, the terrain is very dangerous and they could've fall from any cliff, but at the end, this is probably just an urban legend and hopefully it stays like this. My sincere condolences to the families.",

The more I read though, the more I’m thinking foul play. The one thing I just cannot understand is how two young women who were in constant touch with family did not try to text, or leave any messages about their situation? Also, the trail sounds like it was well used, why didn’t the girls try to shout for help ? Seems to me they could have been ambushed and therefore had limited chances to seek help. The somewhat consistent timings of trying to contact emergency services is also odd. Then the deleted photo file, which experts say can only be permanently deleted by plugging it into a computer? Unless the police accidentally deleted it in their investigation? It just doesn’t add up. I hope one day this can be properly resolved.",

Countryside in latin america is not joke,\r\nI was robbed once after some dude tipped off the criminals, they knew every move, they are local, they will hunt you like they want, local police of those places is either\r\nuseless or corrupted, and often both. In one of the photos you can see the shadow of an arm holding a gun pointing at both of them, probably forcing them to smile for the \r\ncamera, as you can see, the smiles are fake.

Incroyable travail et trop bonne vidéo, merci beaucoup ❤\nJe suis archi d’accord avec ta théorie.\nEn ce qui concerne la photo, moi j’ai l’impression que l’appareil était en mode portrait. Quand tu la tourne, et qu’on pense voir un visage, j’ai l’impression que peut-être elle est en train de crier/pleurer, peut-être en essayant d’appeler a l’aide ou de frustration pck personne ne vient ? Le mouvement des cheveux fait clairement penser qu’elle est soit en train de bouger, soit qu’elle est agenouillée face au sol, ce qui expliquerait pourquoi le mouvement des cheveux peut paraître étrange. \nEn tout cas je connaissais pas du tout cette affaire et elle me glace le sang.",

Au debut je pensais que s’étais juste ses cheveux mais le problème c’est que comparé aux autre cheveux ont a plus l’impression qu’elle sert cette chose comme si elle avait tourner sur elle même pour donner se résultat.

You have to make a life-or-death guess at the exact same time you realize what's happening and start to panic. I got lost like that in a Florida state forest following a false trail for 20 minutes. I miraculously picked the right direction and found an old logging/ranger road after a couple hours. But if I had gone with my first instinct, I could have easily vanished. You are either saving yourself or killing yourself, and you have no way to know which one you're doing. I still dream about it 20 years later. It's a special type of horror.\n\nALSO, I think the missing photo is explained by a good Samaritan. The image before the missing file is Kris's hair. I think Kris fell and injured herself badly, possibly even dying. Lisanne was trying to triage her in the dark by taking pictures. Because of her injury or otherwise grim appearance, the deleted image was shocking. As it would be traumatizing to the families, and the girls were already presumed dead, a nice person deleted it to spare them. Maybe the person who found the backpack or a government official.",

Kriss got caught first by the person or persons and Lisanne later on (different states of decomposed body parts). \n\nJust my thoughts 🤷🤷‍♀️",

And then when for once they connected for two seconds they turned the phone off again!!! If it was them calling they would attempt to reconnect multiple times at that point, nothing else makes sense. Why on earth wouldn't they try to call again afther finally having succes?",

Maybe Lisanne didn’t know Kris' password.\nThe backpack being completely clean after ages in the jungle is what sells the foul play theory for me. Adding the fact that a photo was deleted via computer.... yea, someone - most likely their attacker - took their belongings home, deleted the picture ( probably had something incriminating on it) and planted the backpack and body parts afterwards, along with other belongings. If the shorts were really found folded near the lake - and considering the girls would not purposefully leave it there (obviously)- I believe he planted them too.\nThe perfectly severed foot also leads me to come to the conclusion that it was foul play. Add to that the fact that F is reported to carry around a machete.... yea.\nThe skin is what really confuses me, though.",

But also, the finding of the girls property perfectly in tact, politely placed, shows me that perhaps multiple suspects are involved here. The folding of the clothes and their careful placement possibly points to someone caring, or emotionally moving forward. Perhaps a woman. Perhaps the native woman who came forward with some of the girls property. Indigenous or native persons were brought up a couple times and this also made me wonder, if a native population or village lived in the jungle. It does happen, and perhaps if that is the case maybe the modern locals don’t really mention it. The wrapping up of the case and the criminal investigator who did it, calling it a death by fall, so red flaggy. I know this is a reach, but what if the girls were victims of assault and then canibalism.. the condition of the very view bones.. how they were scattered… the tampering with phones… the cameras deleted photos, and also the people interviewed in the beginning of the case who gave testimonies all over the place. Someone said they got back and asked for cab to leave? Yeah right. To me the whole thing says something horrible happened and many people there know about it…. Also 40 people going missing annually there, is interesting….",

And they’re obviously the ones they were wearing because you can see the distinct colours on their photos. Both girls are well endowed, especially Kris, I can see no reason why they’d remove their underwear themselves. Obviously the killer removed them! \n\nI’m also suspecting the guide like the previous poster mentioned. The fact their taxi driver was also killed meant that he was a local and known to him. He stalked them in the jungle, kidnapped them and Kris died first. Her bones are bleached possibly from the sun after dismembering her body? Possibly left for wildlife to drag away. Lisann was kept until she also passed away from her abuse.",

Scattered bones and dismemberment could have been from carrion animals, but bleached bones...According to forensic research conducted in the UK, it takes about six weeks during summer months in the UK for bones to begin to show signs of whitening and about nine weeks for bones to appear off-white. The UK isn't the jungles of Panama though, so if the bones were exposed to consistent UV rays, perhaps that process would be faster. This doesn't discredit animals from scattering the bones, but the backpack being clean and dry, their bras in the backpack, and an intentionally deleted photo that could only have been deleted by a computer rather than from the phone itself make this suspicious. Something else that doesn't sit well is that jungles are dense. You need a machete at the very least to make your way through if there isn't a path. If they were following a path and got into some difficult terrain, why not turn back? In the picture in which one of the girls looks anxious...the sun was still out. That's the most disturbing picture of all of them to me because that indicates a pivotal moment. Without a forensics team to investigate it, we'll likely never have the answers. As far as hiking alone, I'm not going to blame the victims. When there are two of you, you don't feel alone. And we don't know whether or not they were coerced to go further. My heart goes out to their loved ones.",

Also the fact that they didn’t belong to the native population could have made them a more ideal of being targeted. I hope that I am wrong, but I just can’t get that idea out of my head. As for the missing photo, I think that they captured the person, or persons and was deliberately destroyed or erased entirely. Many prayers to their families.",

Which would also explain the differing decomp stages. I think the picture of the hair was trying to look at an injury or bug or something. although, I do feel the backpack was found earlier on and someone held on to it for some reason - maybe a reward or something. I also watched a video about how if the camera was turned off or something while the photo was still processing it can corrupt the entire file? It is possible someone had their belongings I just don’t feel it was foul play. Rip please be safe out there everyone. Bring proper gear even if you don’t feel you need it. ❤",

This is my first comment after being a subscriber for a long time:  Question - While I also believe foul play was involved (perhaps they first became lost and even incurred some injury prior to introduction of any bad actor), why would a bad actor jump through hoops to delete a photo on one of their cameras when they could just take the camera and dispose of it at their leisure?  I am not asking in a critical manner, but rather very honestly.  Again, I think foul play was involved, but it's just another oddity in a very odd story.  Keep up the great work!",

Also, the photo of her light Strawberry Blonde Hair is so strange... But, if you've traveled in areas where NO ONE has Blonde Hair, you can get a LOT of ATTN./Aggression from men for that hair, alone?!- When it's rare, they're fascinated by this Hair Color, & that could have been part of a crisis encounter?!- Sadly, ANY vulnerable, pretty, young girls can be \"Prey\" around the World!-😢And there are criminal traffickers, firearms & narcotics smugglers in Central American jungles, not to mention, Deadly Snakes!!- They did not know this??.. Rest in Peace!! 🕊\n1) Travel Tip for Women- It's not a good idea to wear low-cut tops, skimpy, or flirty clothes/ short-shorts in any non-Western, foreign country, unless you Know that country well, are with trusted family, etc. It also reveals you're just a tourist & not a Real Hiker to contend with!- Very sad!.😢 Rest in Peace!!-🕊(& I'm not suggesting that they meant to look inviting or \"flirty,\" but international standards & perceptions can differ, greatly!!)-☹",

Probably one of them had an accident along trying to find their way back (they would have gravitated to a bridge given it indicates a marked path) and the other stayed with them and was found by an individual with bad intentions.

I think they have left the trail because an animal or a human was aggressive.\n To the people who are suspicious about Feliciano or the other guys there: you can't label him/them criminal(s) just based on conclusions from a video. Maybe the parents asked him to take some photos along the hike.\nWell, the \"don't tell them\"-sentence is indeed strange. And also I noticed that years later, he used as an explanation for this case that the girls just \"got lost\" and somewhat complained that nobody puts a sign there at the Mirador (see reddit \"My hike with Feliciano part 2\"), but if he can a cross of remembrance there, why not also a sign? Some people seem to know more about it - which does not automatically mean that those people are murderers.\n\nRest in peace, Kris and Lisanne.",

And after seeing this video i think it's not their own fault. I think someone has murdered these girls, also because the pants of Kris were found off much further away. Why should one of another animal have taken her clothes? IMaybe they are dragged by one or several men monsters or maybe they were forced to walk with them. \n\nIt could also be wild animals who dragged there somewhere but if so, how can one of them survive the attack? Because of new photo's were taken a week after. And if it would be a wild animal, the cloths would be very torn apart by claws and teeths and clothes would be full of blood too but they were not, or maybe washed off by the water stream down the river? Whatever it is, they were torn apart, think about the shoe of Lisanne with her foot in one of her shoes, finding lose bones and not 2 whole body's. \n\nIf you lost on 1 path only, i only can imagine a creep who followed them and finally cut the girls into pieces (hope not), because if they die by accident (which is not logic to me after this video), then the body's of both girls would be found as one piece. And they only found a couple pieces like a rib, a hip bone and a handfull of other bones of Kris and Lisanne. That is not a natural death at least. It must be some sick person(s) or animals who had grabbed the girls, otherwise you would not be torn in pieces, unless you were fallen into a river and animals found you later on. But this video showed that was not a possibility because the river they were in was not the first river, so it can't be the first river where they were fallen in to.\n\nI feel so sorry about the sweet girls, Rest In Peace and for the family, i wish you still light, power and strength.",

If they had been kidnapped by someone or a group, the very first thing the offenders would have done is to take away their mobile phone. Although the internet connection is pretty bad, the risk for them would have been far to high. \n\nThe second reason is that a sexual assault takes place in a very short period of time... not during eight days.\nThe different photos taken during the night that don't make sense to a neutral observer could me nothing but a try, realised by these girls, to get some light. Keep in mind that there is entire darkness in the jungle and they might have used the flash of the camera to see there they have to go. \nI'm not sure but the evidence found till now is not sufficent to relate someone to the case.",

Even a layman like myself, can see it's midday. If they were up there at 5:30, there would have been a lot less light.   I still think the taxi driver dropped them off at around 11:30-11:45.\n\nI believe \"Frank\" the shop owner is talking about two different women. I don't think either of the girls had on Lycra?  Correct me if I got that wrong.\n\nThe other confusing issue for me are the two calls made after 4pm. Why were they 12 minutes apart? If it was truly an emergency (i.e. Lisanne breaks foot, etc), why wait so long to make another call? They could not have gone far after the first call.",

The strange night pictures would also be explained!! Either the 2 girls took them when in captivity / lost or the indigenous people didn't know how to operate a camera or phone and just enjoyed the flashlight. Emergency calls suggest the girls had the phones (perhaps after being captured and not being able to use them for 3h?). Deleted photo might be someone on the picture accidently. The night pics do seem very strange but could also be a call for help when they hear a plane or something.",

Otherwise why not just tie it to a tree, or shove it under a rock, something that won't blow away?? A low flying aircraft makes mountainside terrain an echo chamber, I'm sure they heard the search.\n\nThe series of photos. Camera flash comes in handy when it's night in the jungle, you don't have a flashlight and you need to check your surroundings... Just some thoughts🤷🏼‍♀️",

I think they couldn’t move anymore as a team and so they stopped in the area because Kris couldn’t go on and Lis knew that this is probably where she would loose her so she waited in this area and did the flash signals etc. Then possibly after this Lis tried to carry on and the ground was already compromised by the weather and the EARTHQUAKE and she slipped and fell into the river or was so disoriented and desperate at one point Lis tried to follow the river downstream, maybe even possibly try to “float” down with Kris’ body and that was that.",

While it's clear that they got lost and died of natural causes, that may have only happened because they abandoned the path after feeling threatened by people or a person they encountered. That might explain the police's odd reaction and the missing photos. In that circumstance, those individuals didn't even necessarily have to have bad intentions. It's understandable for two young women hiking a narrow one-way trail to feel weary if men started catcalling in a language they couldn't understand. On a city street you could cross the road; in a jungle you might do what they did.",

        "text": "You know, after all these years of longing for answers about what exactly happened during those days in the jungle you really start thinking in strange ways. What bothers me the most in this moment is that there is an answer out there; there is a sequence of events that happened in our objective reality that has the answer to everything. If only you could have been a fly on the wall that fateful day. You probably could have watched Lisanne walk into the room as Kris is sitting at the breakfast table, scrolling thru her phone and ask if she still wants to go on that trip they had talked about the previous night. You could have watched them quickly pack and get a cab... get out near the restaurant. You'd hear Lisanne order the strawberry Kist soda and Kris decide she wants orange. You'd see Kris play with the camera and probably say something funny as she takes a picture of Lisanne studying the map, looking up at her with playful derision. I wonder what it is they talked about thru the fields on the way to the forest. The fly on that day would hear them talk about what they would do in Boquete the upcoming weeks, they're life back home, they're families, they're boyfriends... you'd hear Lisanne explain to Kris what route they were taking to the summit and what they would see along the way. You'd hear them joke and complain and probably a few high pitch shreaks as one of them slipped on the trail, followed shortly by laughter. At the top you'd see Lisanne hand Kris the camera and tell her to make sure she get's a good panoramic view of the mountains behind as she makes a face and points to it. A few seconds later you'd hear Kris say something along the lines of 'me too' as she gives Lisanne the camera back and strikes a pose of her own. You'd hear them discuss going further down the trail on the other side of the mirador. That mystery which has been haunting so many people for over a decade would finally be solved once and for all. You'd see Kris's mood slowly change from happy and enthusiastic to tired and eventually worried and scared. You'd see photo 509 as it's taken. You'd see it slowly get dark, you'd see them leave the trail, get lost and call for help. You'd see them spend the first night in the jungle and the distress in their eyes when the next morning the sun comes up but they are no closer to finding the trail. You'd follow them as they wander further and further towards a river of false hope, you'd see Lisanne break her foot, you'd see them walk for days and days getting nowhere...You'd hear them slowly make their peace with death as they realize no one is coming. You'd sit idly by as they sit huddled together on a rock in the middle of a downpour, taking pictures of the darkness that surrounds them. You'd be there as they take their final breaths, and you'd finally understand with no uncertainty where they were, how they got there and why they couldn't get out. Those are the things that truthfully, I would be terrified of seeing but after all these years... I'm a fly on a leaf as I listen to Kris and Lisanne argue and try to rationalize their situation because I finally saw that fateful wrong turn, that misplaced step that after so many years finally makes it all make sense. I don't have to guess or theorize or stay up anymore reading dead end theories one after the other which all lead back to the beginning of a giant maze. In a way, I too stepped into the jungle with them after hearing their story... and just like them, I fear that I too may never leave.",

Maybe their disappearance had way more attention than the killer wanted. And it worked. Even with a permenatly deleted photo (which would have required a computer), it gave LE and the government enough evidence to latch onto to justifying declaring it an accident. \nIll never understand why, when there is so many questions and so much suspician, its so hard for LE to declare it suspicious instead of declaring a super ridiculous event/death/disappearance/etc an accident.",

The other remains were ONLY discovered by locals who knew him. He was also the only person who knew where the girls were. And if you read the review on google about the tour guide that was left by a single woman, she makes it very clear that he was a creep! Carried a large machete, and had a love for European women. They’re murder was covered up and convoluted by the local authorities.",

The killer who I think personally was the guide that owned the coffee farm was mocking the police because he didn’t think anyone would understand this photo, but it was his trophies demonstrating that he had killed the women.

Instead of staying where they were and waiting for the day, they walked in the night which only made it worse. They started using the camera flash as a flashlight when they heard noises in the jungle and they knew something was coming but they couldn't see it. The last photo is of the person or people that found them. The girls were taken by local men who raped them, beat them to death, and then smashed their bones with large rocks or tools to make the bodies easier to carry. The other DNA was from their other victims. I wasn't there so I don't know what happened but this is my guess. You always pay for a local guide when you're in a remote area. People rely too much on their phones and not enough on each other.",

The strangers agreed to help them, but they had something  else in mind. Their last picture probably was of the people they found. Then, they were guided to the place they were sexually assaulted, murdered and the bodies were disposed. The killer deleted the picture and tried to access the phone to see if there were photos on the phone, too.

The kidnappers missed the pickup because they got delayed by deciding to rape the girls b4 handing over. That meant the kidnappers had to devise a new plan of what to do with them. The gang involved in all this numbered around 6. They decided to sell their organs on the black market. Both girls were killed and their organs sold. The international media bought a lot of heat on these members and they all started getting killed starting from April 2nd. The guide Feliciano was involved because his son was in the gang. All the evidence, photos and body parts were planted to try to close the investigation and bring the heat off. This was all revealed by the mother of one of the gang members after he was killed. She fled to Costa Rico to seek legal aid and a new life. That is probably what happened. That track was a known drug and people smuggling route. RIP young ladies, you certainly didn't deserve this. Let this be a warning to all young people to check and do proper research before travelling anywhere and take precations as needed or warrented!",

They could have been using the camera in those 7 days to document exactly what was happening and even get pics of each other as well. They could have given a goodbye message to loved ones via the camera. Also why wouldn't they send just one text message or leave something written on the phone as an unsent text or a text note? So many things that could have been done to give people an idea of what was going on over the 8 day period. The bra's thing is a weird one as well, why on earth would you take your bra off if you were freezing in a jungle with no coat? There are so many questions for this case.",

What caused their demise is that they made an uninformed decision to be out there unguided and to cross the point of the continental divide and then were clearly lost and left very unprepared.  They went many a mile for days through an impossible maze.   Had to be an awful struggle.  Kris was in a bad fall that smashed her foot and was immobilized if not dead.  I think Lisann took all those night time photos at around that time/location, hoping to see Kris in the dark below and/or to mark the the spot in hope of eventual recovery.  Lisann eventually became too weak to go on and thus passed from lack of nutrition or a fall/injury.  Too bad - was close to village of Alto Romero. They, desperate to survive, didn't record notes so as to preserve battery power.  There's no shortage of freaks in this world, but they weren't killed by some freak, but by the elements.  They eventually succumbed and all that moisture accelerated decay and scattered their remains.  Water is a very powerful solvent over time and this region gets over 10 feet of rain annually.  RIP girls.",

That is critical because on the side of a huge slope you know which way is up and down for reference but not when you are on a crest--ALL trails lead down. also with the rain starting they now were in dark and many trails would then be impassable. they were not murdered and it ESPECIALLY was not the womanizing guide. they operated camera and phone for DAYS. why did he find the bones? because he knew people get lost and they likely went down the wrong side. that is why guides and experienced hikers can often go right to a body. OF COURSE he found the bones he was an expert of the area thats why he saw them last alive. The mexicans were right--during the various monsoons the bodies got tumbled down stream and got ripped and torn apart and decomposed. \n\nwhy the bloody hair photo? they both like did DOZENS of slips and falls. she may well have wanted to see the injury with the flash.  why was the pack found \"pristine\". the camera card and likely the camera would not be affected especially in the case. it got blasted down and got stuck as the cannibal woman said. the rain subsides and things dry out that does not mean the pack would be all muddy at all. after drying it would be just like something drying out of the laundry. also you can WASH a calculator in the machine and let it dry out--it will work perfectly ive done it. the location of the pack out of the water proves how high the floods were. The pack would float--thus got caught up high. keep in mind an iphone--is almost waterproof for instance mine I lost in the snow and went back and got it from the slush and it was fine. remember the pack was not submerged. THEY GOT LOST FOLKS no cannibals got them at all if they did they would not have brought pack. 120% of the conditions were there for them to get injured and lost in the dark and rain.",

Ce dernier les auraient « aider » en les ramenant chez lui. Ils auraient pu les enfermer et ces dernières auraient réussi à s’échapper (d’où les photos prises). Mais le guide les a retrouvé et attaqués en mettant en scène un accident. Ensuite il était toujours dans le coin pour connaître l’avancée de l’enquête et mettre en scène les éléments trouvés.

Personnellement, j'utilise \"Eraser\" (gratuit) qui permet une suppression sécurisée(méthode Gutmann / 35 passes. La police aurait donc pu utiliser un de ces logiciels.. Nota : US Army et US Air Force utilisent le logiciel que j'ai cité.",

Vraiment ! Qui attendrait le lendemain pour faire ce deuxième appel? Absolument PERSONNE! La vérité ? C'est qu’elles n’étaient pas seules quand elles sont arrivées tout en haut. Et qu’elles ont progressivement eu peur. Elles ont probablement  fait un seul appel avec leurs appareils respectifs et qu’ils ont ensuite ete confisqué  par les criminels ! Les autres tentatives d'appel sont de l’enfumage. Provocation des bandits, simples erreurs manuelles ou volonté de noyer le poisson. Clairement, elles ont rapidement perdu la liberté de leur mouvement, leurs objets et leurs vies.  La bouteille d’eau a ete retrouvé dans un sac à dos propre, et à moitié pleine!!

Detto questo, una cosa mi viene da pensare.. da qualche parte ho letto di una fotografia (la numero 509?) che sarebbe stata cancellata dalla sequenza delle fotografie, forse da una terza persona, che probabilmente voleva eliminare una foto “scomoda”. \nO, si dice, dalla polizia stessa, che avrebbe addirittura Photoshoppato molte altre fotografie.\nOk... ma perché prendersi il disturbo di cancellare una fotografia, o modificarne altre, quando sarebbe bastato eliminare fisicamente baracca e burattini, ovvero la macchina fotografica stessa e tutto lo zaino, invece di piazzarlo lì in bella mostra? \nChe depistaggio sarebbe, far riapparire dal nulla lo zaino con tutto il suo inquietante contenuto, tra cui cellulari e Canon? \nPerché non buttarlo in un dirupo e via? \nCi sono troppi punti che non quadrano, ogni ipotesi potrebbe essere quella giusta, ma c’è sempre un dettaglio che non si incastra come dovrebbe",

        "text": "I believe they were captured by a serial killer who might have connections with the local police or knows how to sabotage the investigation. Wherever he was keeping them was probably underground or too far from the tower, so there was no reception and he knew it. It was never mentioned that for quite a while their phones kept turning on around the same time just before dawn. It’s a little strange for someone lost in the jungle without a watch, while it is still dark (they couldn’t know the time before turning the phone on). This gives an idea that every morning this perpetrator could have been leaving the place, maybe for some morning farming duties, which most likely woke up the girls too, and they desperately tried to use this as any other moment he wasn’t around to call 112 or 911. Clean cut of the ankle and such small fragmentation of bodies could also point at someone who is familiar with farming and handling meat. Everything else like this completely dry backpack with everything in place, strange photos are nothing more but an excellently plotted plan to disorient investigators. This guy or guys know the best way to get rid of personal belongings - leave them untouched as if there was no foul play. And as expected, police gets manipulated by this and has nothing else to do but to close the case as an accident.",

I think that one of them may have suffered an accident and injury, which would explain the first emergency call not long after the last ‘normal’ photo, but it’s less likely that both of them would have suffered the same accident. \n\nWhile some things don’t add up and a case can be made for the foul play theory, I think on balance the most logical explanation is that they were ill-prepared, warned not to go without a guide but continued on a trail they were unfamiliar with in conditions and an environment they weren’t used to, got lost (and possibly injured) and sadly died from exposure.\n\nI know true crime fans are predisposed to concluding that every unexplained disappearance or death must involve foul play, but some of the theories in the comments here about criminal conspiracies etc. are outlandish in my opinion. Sadly there is a lot of misinformation out there about this case, the police investigation has also been criticised and there is a language barrier which can result in mistranslation etc. which can all influence what one thinks about the case. \n\nWhat’s not up for debate is that this is a really sad tragedy and I think a learning point for anyone that if you are going into any potentially hazardous environment, to make sure you’ve got some knowledge and equipment/supplies to help keep you safe in the event anything untoward happens, and to know your limits.",

They tried to call emergency services several times but were unable to get through. They continued deeper into the rain forest and at some point came to the river. They decided to follow the river thinking it would lead them to civilization. Instead, it lead them further and further away. They survived for days based on phone and camera data but at some point perished due to lack of food, exhaustion and possibly dysentery from drinking the river water. One of them probably died first and the other stayed in that area and was probably too weak to continue. I point you to the story of Amanda Eller who was lost in Hawaii for 17 days in an area significantly smaller than this. No way some gang or rapist is going to follow someone 10 miles into the rainforest to kill them. Also, a criminal wouldn't let them use their phone and camera repeatedly. The mystery photos are the result of trying to use the flash to see at night or to scare away an animal in the bushes. Lastly, the dog that was with them was very familiar with the area. When if got dark the first night, the dog peaced out and found his way home. I work in wilderness search and rescue and it is not uncommon for people to get off a trail and never find their way back, wandering for days until finally succumbing. I point you to the story of Geraldine Largay who's body was found less than two miles from the trail after getting lost.",

Too many people connected to this case died already, taxi driver, journalist who wrote about the case and corrupt system in Panama, another guy connected to youth gang. Also i've read that other tourist and tourist couple heard women screams from jungle. And tour guide filmed another Red haired woman from behind, similar to night photo. Also why their host allowed tour guide and woman from school into their room? And if it had been an accident where is the rest of the bones? Whose were the other bones found with theirs? Why dna from backpack and bra hadn't been tested?\nAlso Panama's Police originally treated this case as abduction and then suddenly they are adamant it's an accident.\nAnd cctv is accidentaly deleted.\nNo way they got lost\nAnd that \"don't say anything about..\" and video cut off after that.",

They didnt manage to catch him and end up in the middle on the jungle not knowing where to go. Maybe they drank like water from the rain and ate like Fruits they found or something? And the one girl got this head injury and because of that died first and the other girl tried to use her phone, couldn't get in and died too. The Bones could have been taken by animals, that ate her flesh and on that way the Bones got away. The bleached bone is too weird for me to explain. I think they wanted to do a very Little hike just because they were curious. Oh and the photos i think they took to Look if they were Walking in circles.",

Like Juan quoted there was photoshoped pics in order to give a wrong track and confusing us. I do really believe that on this day the taxi driver brought the girls to the Caldera Hot Springs in Paja de Sombrero. It was a planned kidnapping for this day after Plinio and his guys do plan days before. The cropy picture with the two guys and girls are indicating for me that they have spent that day on that location. Then they got into the car and abducted for trafficking. Wealthy guys have paid for this and the taxi driver and thet two guys know the abducter/ perpetrator. Due the high media sensation and pressure the risk was high that it come into the light, so they have decided to elimante all attendend who be a potential threat for that gang cartel. We should scope out the map and take focus on that potential area. I think we are close to solve the case. Cheers!",

Here are my reasons:\n-Bone bleaching (foreign materials commonly used in the Mexican Cartel) \n-There seemed to be a method to the bone placing as well and when you think about it, if it had been accidental they would have found more of the bones than they did. \n-They did not release the autopsy report and this strange case was kept pretty low on the news forecast.\n-The phone password also seems to have been planned. The person who entered the password must have had the intention of erasing evidence or something because they would have not entered so many password if they needed help (knowing it would take longer to get it).\n-The photos also had a method to them and I believe some of it was staged. I think the whole thing was staged to play off of these girls’ adventure and getting lost. \n\nThese were my reasonings for it being foul play",

At the end we will never know. Those photos at the end look suspicious to me .. but i dont know..people here (panamenians) thought that maybe it was a indigens tribe that does canibalism ( we have those) they live very remote nobody messes with them really. But i could be wrong .. at the end i just thought why in hell they went alone.

        "text": "In another video, the parents of Kris Kremers took the same trail to get an idea of the terrain the young women faced months earlier. They stated that there could have been no way for the ladies to have gotten lost because thick vegetation surrounds the trail on both sides. However, I think they did not factor in the following: 1) They retraced their daughter's steps already knowing the outcome. Hindsight is always viewed with 20/20 glasses; 2) The parents had guides with them and could have never gotten lost, whereas Kris and Lisanne were unguided and unfamiliar with the area; 3) Having hiked countless trails in many countries (including tropical ones) myself, there is always the main trail but animal trails and washes that look like trails, many single-track and narrow, are always present. It would be easy for inattentive newbies talking and snapping photos to start walking along one of these by mistake; 4) Kris's parents took a day trip and brought the necessary gear and supplies, but as we know based on the calls that were made on Kris and Lisanne's phones, that the two were out there for days with insufficient food and clothing. People have commented that they could have simply walked out. Seemed like Kris had gotten injured and Lisanne could not, or did not want, to leave her. With each passing day, the lack of food and exposure to the elements would have taken a toll on them mentally and physically. Other thoughts: Why did they take night shots of seemingly random things? Jungles come alive at night. I'd be doing the same thing if there were things moving around and making sounds in the darkness. Why did they call 112 (the equivalent of 911) in the Netherlands? My guess is because it was familiar to them. They had not been in Panama for very long after all and would have known that calling their homeland's emergency agency would have been more reliable than calling the hostel where they were staying. The Dutch responders would have immediately known to contact their parents to make them aware of the situation. Of course the rest of this tragic story raises more questions than answers and has many parts, but this is just my take about one of those parts.",

Finding only some parts of the body so that an autopsy could not be done. The photos seem to have been taken on purpose to prove that they were lost. \nFurthermore, the guide cannot be ruled out just because he did not attack the journalist, knowing that he was investigating and others knew it, he would have been a complete idiot, he was never a suspect for the authorities because they always said it was an accident. \nI don't understand how you ignore a review on Tripadvisor from a woman who says Feliciano threatened her and to be careful, especially European women, this thing gives you the creeps. Not to mention the fact that he went into their room looking for who knows what. \nOne thing I find very suspicious is that the school sent them away after everything was organized, it almost seems like it was done on purpose to lure them into a trap.\nUnfortunately, the investigation ruined the little evidence that there was. \nI really feel sorry for these poor girls, I wonder how scared they were...",

I and many others belive this was foul play and every local who was interview by the news said that it would be impossible for someone to get lost in the two trails going up to the mountain top without being found.",

Peut-être qu'en s'avançant dans la forêt, les filles se seraient bien évidemment perdues, seraient tombées sur une tribu cannibale ou bien des habitants locaux qui les auraient pris en otage et leur auraient fait du mal d'où les cris et coups entendus par le touriste. Elles auraient donc pris des photos et essayer d'appeler les secours en vain pour être sauver mais ont finis par être tuer et manger d'où les os un peu rongés. Les locaux n'auraient donc rien dit pour garder une bonne image et auraient cacher le reste des corps. Je sais que les pistes criminelles sont moins probables mais tout est possible.",

Il a apparemment eu l'artère de la jambe gauche sectionnée, selon les deux experts qui l'ont examiné, l'un nommé par le procureur Ricci et un autre désigné par le père du jeune homme.\n\nSimon Gautier avait disparu le 9 août 2019, alors qu'il randonnait sur la côte au sud de Naples. Il a été retrouvé mort dimanche 18 août 2019, dans un ravin. \nUne enquête pour \"homicide involontaire\" a été ouverte ce mercredi en Italie. Elle vise à faire la lumière sur les circonstances de la mort du randonneur mais aussi sur l'organisation \ndes secours après l'appel passé par Simon Gautier aux urgences italiennes. \r\n\r\nMort rapidement après son appel au secours :\r\nSelon l'enregistrement de l'appel de détresse, diffusé par des médias italiens, Simon avait expliqué être tombé d'une falaise et s'être cassé les deux jambes, mais sans pouvoir dire où il se trouvait, \"au milieu de nulle part, sur la côte\". Les secours avaient lancé des recherches, restées vaines pendant plusieurs jours. Le randonneur ne répondait plus à son téléphone. Selon l'autopsie, il serait en effet mort quelques minutes seulement après avoir appelé les secours. \r\n\r\nCe n'est que dimanche 18 aout 2019, soit neuf jours après sa disparition, qu'un secouriste avait repéré le sac à dos du Français, aux jumelles. Son corps avait été retrouvé tout près.\r\n\r\nRapatriement jeudi 22 aout 2019 en France :\r\nUne veillée de prières en hommage au jeune homme était organisée mardi soir dans une église de la commune la plus proche. Les amis de Simon Gautier, présents sur place jusqu'alors, vont quitter la région ce mercredi. Le corps du jeune homme qui vivait à Rome a été rapatrié jeudi 22 aout 2019 en France.\n\nSi ça se trouve, c'est quelque chose de ce genre qui est arrivé à Lisanne et à Kris.",

Je pense que c'était soit pour son amie ou que c'était peut-être pour se repérer? Peut-être qu'à force de s'enfoncer dans la jungle elles pensaient tourner en rond et elles voulaient etre sûres si elles retournaient sur leurs pas ou quelque chose du genre,\nEnfin je sais pas trop, c'est juste des idees comme ça \n(PS la video est super malgré les événements tragiques)",

Thank you,.  \nSo many discrepancies. \nIf they were injured or one was, the only thing that makes sense is, one tried to go for help alone (which rather seems unlikely) \nBut if they were together , at first and one was injured , wouldn't they take a pic or two  to document  what happened ? \nAlmost seems plausible they were taken some kinda hostage or something, \nIf you're gonna take 90 photos in 3 hrs,\nSeems like a few of them would have been \nof your situation, unless they were prevented from doing so , but that scenario has holes in it, too.....\nI'm so sorry for both girls families and friends! \n\nThis is the 2nd time I've run across this and it's more confusing now than before",

The Kris s mimics give her way.. \nThey were taken aback in baranco.. \nOn this pic I see a rape this is a woman and black man, left side upper corner. \nThe head of woman is injured by white stick.. \nThe man put woman's feet on his shoulders.. \nFirst I though it's Lissane.. But now I think girls became an unwelcome witnesses of this crime.. They took this pic on their way running back.. As this pic is not clear.. \nGuys attacked girls, and the girls s young friends simply ran away.. \nBut they also were not the canibals target.. \nCannibals rabbits need girls and feliziano and his son, friends helped them to provide it.. \nOn a pic there the Kriss near the cave.. \nOn the right side there is a handmade idol in a stick and on this idol I see a rabbits head with long ears.. (Right side) \nThe cave full of women dead corpuses of white bodies.. \nAround this place masks (a face with cows corns) \nThis brown headed girl sitting on this cave (left side upper top of this cave's roof) her head injured with white stick and her legs partly eaten.. She is in brown shirt.. \nOn the right side I see monkey, 3 black African men in feathers and a victim a woman hanging upside down in boots and this indigious cut this body for consumption.. A lot of blood.. \nPolice or somebody else cut these pictures and put a Photoshop.. On it.. \nBecause tribe shouting girls on Cam did pictures and girls also.. \nThey took girls mobiles.. Trying to enter the pin.. \nI think girls were alive for 2-max 3 days.. \nLisan die first.. Maybe at the first day \nThey liked more Kriss.. \nThere were some over girls not only Kriss and lisan, I see a lot of white dead bodies.. \nOn the left side a bull s skull.. \nI think this rabbit tribe eat animals and white women.\nGirls refused Feliziano and he asked his son and his friends to help him to drop girls deeply to the jungle \nWith they help of drag they made girls feel more relaxed.. And did this crime..\nCannibals did video about religious killing \nThis band can sell such videos to rich perverts\nIf they were searching for Kris and lisan why they r not searching for this girl and others?",

        "text": "One thing that most researchers seem to have missed or overlooked is that Kris Kremer's parents walked the exact same trail and they had cell phone reception at the summit of the Pianista trail and even beyond at the river crossing where the last photo was taken. This invalidates the entire scenario that the girls couldn't get cell phone connections along the trail. Something is seriously amiss with the narrative about their inability to connect with emergency services or anyone else in Boquete. By the way, why didn't they contact someone in Boquete or simply send text messages? That's a bit strange. Seems like they must've been at another location without cell phone reception when they were calling for help.",

They were prepared for a day walk, not a serious injury and this might have thrown them for a loop. Perhaps their intiial belief was help would come, or they would simply call for help, but as time went by, phones draining, injury growing worse,  hunger and panic setting in, one mistake led to another catastrophic mistake after another.  Soon it was just Kris, dazed, hungry and trying to find her way back but completely lost.",

The later photos where the girls became separate could be b/c they became exhausted during the hike, and the initial excitement from exploring a new place died down. Ik i'd be that way, especially while doing physical activities after a while. Or maybe those later pics were when they realized they were being followed, maybe they pretended to be taking pictures while having Chris turn around to keep track of the stalker? Maybe the girls didnt want to look panicked/aware of their presence, and were doing that to detect/track them. im guessing about the pics, but them being aware of an imminent threat explains why they didnt have time to write notes or leave a voice memo(in order to keep quiet, maybe they managed to lose the stalker/attacker for a while and were on the run) but still got access to their phones for days\n\nl think the girls became aware that someone was stalking them, maybe got a picture of that person and somehow managed to get away from them for days before their stalker caught up. I'm still really unsure and confused about a lot of things on this case though, this is a strange one",

And if there are no fingerprints at all that points to a conspiracy along with the photo removed by forensic software. My hypothesis; the hiking guide is part off a crime ring that operates in the town and pays off the cops. The fact that the German tourist was kidnapped by members of the recue team supports a theory of deep corruption in the society. I avoid small towns in remote areas for this very reason. They often have their own set of laws and outsiders pay the price, sometimes with their lives.",

The two girl unintentionally missed the track, and went down into cliff or deep valley, where they found water spot or lake. where they decided to swim, thinking it's safe but it's not, it's a trap either by containing muddy water or slippery edges. girls took off their bras, and put them gently in the backpack and start swimming, one of them lost balance for some reason and start sinking, other one tried help but to no avail., survivor got panic, she didn't know what to do!, she starting calling emergency numbers, (but let's remember, they were in deep location which mean no signal), (normally, signal in such areas is weak on ground level forget about deep location). survivor girl spent rest of the afternoon trying to help her friend, she could not do any better, night came, making things more complicated, she started walking and getting away from the entrance, then she became totally lost. Camera photos shows sky and stars, which means someone in deep cliff looking for help from someone who is on top. Additionally, the girl was using camera flash as response/react to the sounds from the jungles which very scarry to single girl within dark jungle. Girl used camera flash to find her way not for documenting anything. for broken foot, it can be due to dead body smashing during river pulling and moving. It was bad day, and bad choice for both. in foreign country, you must have tour guide. feel so sorry for 2nd girl, she spent her last 10 days in her life in real horrors.",

        "text": "The case is clear cut.  Two girls who were ill-prepared for the journey they put themselves on, got lost in the jungle.  Because they were ill-prepared, they likely succumbed to the mental rigors that dehydration and likely hypothermia they would have suffered at night would have taken on them.  The one fell at some point, hence the broken foot in the boot, this wouldn't have happened at the time of the fall but the girls were out in the jungle for at least 12 weeks til they were found.  When Lisanne fell, Kris after time knew she was the one stuck to go get help either before or after Lisanne was dead.  The pictures at night are to mark where Lisanne was left so that if Kris found help, they could go rescue or recover Lisanne.  Studies show bones become fully bleached after 9 weeks.  Animals would have scavenged on whatever was available of their bodies for food.  They were following a river, because usually following a river downstream leads to civilization, the bag went into the water at some point and went downriver, if it ended up on the shore, it could have been there for days in the pounding sun to dry.  All of this is a tragic accident and a lesson that when the battle is human vs nature, nature will always win.  But let's suppose you want the foul play theory.  A. would the girls have been allowed to try to call for help repeatedly over the course of several days?  B. would the backpack ever have been found?  Seriously, there was like 80 dollars in there, in an impoverished area.  It wouldn't have been taken?  Come on.  C.  Would the phones ever have been found with abductors knowing that incriminating evidence could have been on the camera.  But sure, lets say they just deleted the one photograph instead.  D. Would the bodies have even ever been found?  Logically, an abduction murder makes no sense given the facts of the case.",

They most likely switched their phones off after the calls failed to go through to conserve battery power and decided on calling emergency services one time a day. Sadly, Kris may have met her end first leaving Lisanne alone which could explain the wrong pin being entered on Kris' phone. The night time pictures may have been markers for anyone who found the camera. \n\nI think there was shady stuff going on after they were already dead. The Government was probably covering things up to protect their tourist industry. But I don't see much evidence to imply that they were abducted. The tour guide going into their room for  30 minutes alone while the girls were missing was suspicious . But the pictures that were released don't really indicate someone was following them and their calls also don't indicate they were frantically trying to get ahold of help because they were in immediate danger from someone. As for the deleted picture, I actually believe it was the police that deleted the photo to hide something, again to protect their tourism. This is a sad case overall and I mourn for these girls and their families.",

It can take 6 - 9 weeks, depending on varying factors, for bones to bleach naturally. \n\nI think it is possible the girls got lost, panicked, and Kreemer slipped and hit her head while searching for a high point to gain signal and call for help. \n\nAs for what happened to Froon.. That I don't know. I doubt she would have wanted to leave her injured friend, but once Kreemer passed, she would have had to move to avoid Kreemer's remains attracting predators to her location. I think this would also explain why Kreemer's remains were so scattered - Possibly Vultures? \n\nFrom this point, Froon could have also died of natural causes - But I think it is more likely she was killed, and their backpack was taken. \n\nI think the key to their deaths lies with their backpack. They should have questioned the lady who found it more thoroughly - She may have known more than she was letting on, or could even have been responsible for Froon's death. \n\nSuch a tragic story. At least we can hope they didn't die alone - They had each other in their final moments. May they rest eternally.",

I'm sure it was one of those pix that was just mistakenly taken, and they obviously had bigger worries than going through photos and weeding them out. Still made my hair prickle though! 😮❤",

(It may explain why Samsung was never switched off till it died out). Her friend had to be the nurse and must have been the one flashing the night photos as an sos call and powering the phones even days after they disappeared. They must have tried jungle survival thereafter for some days near the sream/river but unfortunately died either out of water poisoning, sickness or animal bite before they could get help. This is consistent with their remains and back pack being found along the river. \n\nLighting a fire, would have triggered smoke and the search parties would have probably located them much earlier.   \n\nFoul play theory is less likely coz their bodies, back pack and valuables would never have been found since the attacker(s) would have concealed all traces of direct evidence.",

The flash photos could be their attempt to travel at night or keep dangerous animals away from them at night....or like you said, trying to signal for help. Then animals ate them and tracked their bodies around the area.   Very sad.  People travel and take for granted they will be safe (like expecting Disney animal friendliness).

They went over the divide and one of them got injured (Lisanne’s foot was found to be broken) and so couldn’t get back up the divide. They had a choice. Split up and Kris go and seek help, and they died separately, or stay and die hoping they’d be found.",

However, watching it in @Kyle Hates Hiking, I was watching it on the YouTube app on my smart TV, its a huge screen. I noticed something. In the picture of her hair, there is a dark colored finger in the lower left of her hair. It is without doubt  a thumb. It is very clear on my TV. I can see the finger nail just under the hair, the joint an knuckle are just about half an inch from the nail. You can see the imprint of the knuckle clear as day. It is most definately not her friend. This is an indigenous person. Just an opinion, however, I believe she may have already passed in the pic. Also, an opinion, but I believe this person was intrigued by her hair, an maybe was using the light from the camera to view her hair because of its u ique texture and color, accidently taking the photo. For most her hair is relatively normal, as we are used to seeing blonde. They likely may have seen blondes but never up close. Just a theory on that, but it is definately the finger if an indigenous person.",

That's not surprising, because the jungles of Panama are extremely dangerous, not because of natives but because of mountains and wild animals. Jungles are inherently dangerous.  All the so called \"strange\" facts in this case can easily be attributed to the language barrier of Dutch and Spanish, and then to English when we get the story. The only reason we are still talking about it is because 2 attractive Dutch girls were missing, and we have photos. It's a tragedy, not a mystery, but a sure fire audience puller that just keeps on giving.",

How can you think about \"Maybe\" they go out because they're young? \"Maybe\" young girls can be kidnapped, or in trouble, ever think about that? Especialy when you get the knowledge from the host family at the time they have only stuff in their bags for a short trip and being dressed for only a short day trip. Why wait? They knew it's gonna be cold at night, so they would never go away any longer in shorts and a t-shirt that late. THINK! Don't take messages of missing persons too easy, it could be very wrong, proven here again. \n\nThere is something happened wrong if they were smart enough to follow the paths, to walk back on one point when they realise the time for sunset. I think an accident maybe accidentally falling from a hight where they couldn't climb up again or being murdered by someone or a wild animal. Otherwise body parts wouldn't be sepperated. I think they were murdered anyway, maybe after an accidentally fall, wild animals smell blood and maybe they were attacked. Otherwise, if they were attacked by a wild animal, then Lisanne would be attacked at the same time and could not have taken photo's anymore of Kris her hair, so how should she escaped a wild animal who is faster than a human being? I don't think it was a wild animal by that reason, but it's not sure.\n\nIm affraid they met a human murderer :(. But why? And how could he escape in the jungle and not been lost as well?\n\nIt's all to blame at stupid \"rescuers\" that help came too late. It must have been terrified last days, knowing you gonna die, being hungry and thirsty as well. The suffering must been horrible anyway. It must be so scary to be in that situation. \n\nRest in peace Kris and Lisanne 😢🥀🥀",

The severed foot probably happened post mortem from her body being washed downstream{they were on a steep mountain side} clean breaks from a fall aren't uncommon. April 1st was the beginning of the rainy season, although it didn't rain much the first week they were missing it rained a lot by the time the bones were found. \nThey had both taken their bras off and put them in the backback because they're uncomfortable to wear longer than 8 hrs and there was no reason for them to put them back on being lost out in the rain forest.\nThe bottom line is they should have had a guide with them or did more of their own research of the trail first if they were going to go alone.",

Looks like they were kind of in a good waiting place. They were calling for help, they were basically waiting to be rescued. The pics Lisane took show they felt they were in a safe location to wait it out for help. She was taking the pictures to scare off whatever predator(s) was in the area to eat them at that moment. At this point, it appears Kris wasn't moving. Perhaps she had already expired and the smell was attracting the beasts. Lisane probably deleted photos to create more room to take more, as the flash was working to keep the wild animals away. They figured someone would pin-point their cell phones eventually and rescue them. They figured all they had to do was wait. They were keeping their battery alive by shutting off the phone so the phones could be tracked. The bag was so intact because of where they were located. I think they were posted up somewhere with some coverage. Clearly the beasts got a hold of them eventually, the smell of death attracts them heavily.",

The perpetrators had plenty of time to get rid of the bodies, to scatter the bones in different locations, and to place the backpack in a well-known spot by the river, though it had never been seen there before. They also had time to mislead the rescue teams and the police investigation. The local people were too afraid to speak about what might really have happened.

        "text": "I watched many documentaries about this case a couple of years ago, I settled on the conclusion that it was definitely foul play. Recently, I read an article in the newspaper about this case and decided to do a fresh deep dive as its always  really fascinated me. I now truly believe it was a tragic accident. There is so much false information out there regarding this case. Outlandish lies. Such as the shorts being neatly folded, the bag being in perfect condition and the famous nighttime headshot photo which apprently  shows a serious head injury (it absolutely does not). \n\nI think people just love a sensational story. Myself included, and naturally, we look for the most exciting or scary version of a story rather than looking at the cold, hard facts. \n\nIf you do a really good deep dive into this case I think you will also realise it was in fact nothing more then being injured and lost in a massive jungle. \n\nPoor girls 😢",

If someone didn't show up for an appointment, I'd assume they changed their mind. Seems quite aggressive to show up and what, demand they do the tour? Lol",

Beyond the official explanations, I feel there were layers not spoken — an initial accident, yes, but then human interference that deepened their fate. The scattered remains, the condition of the bones, and the strange night photos all point to more than the jungle alone.\n\nI work in the field of energy and remembrance, helping souls and spaces release what binds them and magnify peace. When I attune to Kris and Lisanne, I feel them not trapped, but free — luminous, standing as guardians for those who travel.\n\nYour work is powerful in bringing these hidden stories forward.

That adds to the mystery, because if you delete an image and take another, the camera system will overwrite that image number. So it was deleted later, after the later images were taken.\n\nSome of the speculation is that 509  deliberatley or accidentally caught a picture of someone involved in what happened to the two women.\n\nAdditionally, a number of people involved in the case have since died, including the taxi driver who took them to the walk start and claimed local gang members wanted to know about them.\n\nFinally, the darkness and rain photos have been since found to be mostly taken in the same space. Using clever software beyond me, some people have managed to stitch them together into a 3D image rather like a Google streetview, with rock walls on either side, with foliage above, and the big bare rocks with the women's equipment laid out on them as a kind of emergency signal.",

And either it was a person, who also had the means to wipe it, but if so, why not wipe the whole thing and make it look blank, more natural. To me sounds more like authorities withholding info and pics...either to make a case in the future possibly,  or something so unbelievable, they decided the public doesn't need to see it? Also that one pic where they said it's one of the girls down in a ravine....does not look like them,  or even a human tbh😮..I don't know. It sucks though. Hate to imagine people, anybody being so afraid of someone or something right before losing thier lives",

It’s obvious from the photos their last day was spent by a river, in the rain. There was a flash flood, and that’s all the explanation needed. Sure there was criminal activity in the town.

Someone needs to check the timeline of who was staying g in the Hostel when the girls were there and if someone returned to the hostel when the backpack was placed back in the jungle or if someone person has had a many months stay at the hostel.

I wish Dr van der Gaat and his guys, or you, or anyone... had hiked and searched the trail in the same weather conditions and time of year the girls were lost. Just take pics at the same spots, watch out for the shadows/sun and for the rock formations - exact rock positions don't change even in a few years...   That would have answered many questions and they also would have been able to access the Culebra terrain.  The women had a sunny, dry day, seemingly only half the mountains overcast, rest blue. It is obvious in their photos that even the river rocks they climbed were dry as well as the forest floor.  I've watched several hikes of El pianista, some in part, some far beyond the Mirador, but every time those hikes seem to show completely different trails, especially after the viewing point. The vid with the parents in 2014 doesn't even remotely look like some of the other images depicted in videos. When they reach the river rocks, they conclude this is where Krist stood. It looks similar, but was it? I thought the rocks looked a tiny bit different... Why do some say it was the direction towards Boquete (back) and some say it was leading away? When the parents go further beyond the mirador and even the riverbed the trail they took indeed didn't seem to offer any chance to get lost or fall or get injured.  But it also doesn't look like what I saw in other videos at all, where the trail became quite tight, then thickly wooded, even dark. Instead they end up in another type of open meadow like the beginning of the trail. That's confusing. Were they lead another route? Now I found ratings of this trail on different web sites and more than half of the hikers (for instance on alltrails) say they needed gps or that they even got lost because there were no signs. How could they encounter this problem if there is only ONE way? Also the trail that Google maps suggests as \"el pianista\" (and you can walk the Ave. Buenos Aires and see its entry on google) seems to NOT be the El pianista, but the actual el Pianista trail has its entrance further up right by the restaurant, it is alleged. Then at one time I found a hiker's site that is all about the surrounding rain forest trails of Boquete. It specifically mentions that the Culebra Trail leads into the el pianista trail ! which I never saw mentioned anywhere. It also mentions at least one hidden waterfall at pianista, so hidden that even most local hikers don't know where it is. So there must be other paths on that trail, it is not ONE way - whatever that proves. As for the sculls and other remains, animals love to carry them miles away and hide them and more often than not searchers don't find sceletal remains and later they turn up. I believe they will eventually be found.",

In this case the 'guide' (well reported about on google searches he doesn't take much finding) knows an awful lot more than he has declared publicly. A person who was one of the last to see them alive, gained access to their room and possessions the following day before they were officially 'missing' and then handled evidence that turned up in the river a few kilometres from his property and many km's from their supposed last known location is more than coincidence or bad luck. Having read through Scarlet's excellent write up (foul play theory) and this one (lost in the jungle theory) it is difficult to conclude which was the more likely outcome and plenty of armchair investigators have tried... One thing i've never seen addressed or analysed in great depth though is the timings between the two emergency calls on 1st April which intrigue me- the first one at 16.39 then another just over ten min's later- if someone(s) was stalking/chasing me then it would be a frenzy of multiple call attempts in a short space of time, praying that at least one connects. The ten min delay suggests maybe the situation is not desperate and they hoped a significant change of location could work- go this way more or in that way or- logically- try to get higher up? Perhaps also, this would explain why in one case 19 hours goes by between attempts. If one girl was injured then it would've been slow progress to find a better spot but I find it inconceivable they didn't encounter other people at some point unless they were seriously off piste or... we're back to foul play and the irrefutable mystery surrounding photo #509 again aren't we?",

And why was flesh found on part of the remains of only one of the girls where as the other was completely clean and no cut, crush or breaks in the clean bone? I know I can’t accuse someone of being guilty with no proof, however the coffee rancher has wonderful reviews however they are from mixed couples and one single review by a female leaves a jarring review of his inappropriate comments and actions. Disturbing. Whatever the outcome I pray the girls are resting in peace and that the families and communities are able to continue in their journey of healing. \n❤️\nWonderful video with awesome narration!",

J'ai depuis regardé une bonne vingtaine de tes sujets.\nCette affaire est troublante et révoltante il a tellement pu se passer de choses que ça a tendance à nous retourner le cerveau assez vite. Un de mes amis se rend à Boquete à la mi-mars et va sûrement faire El pianista et le volcan, j'aurais du être du voyage mais je n'avais que 10 jours de disponibilité c'est vraiment dommage. J'ai aussi découvert les disparus de Boscodon à travers ta chaîne et si jamais tu revenais dans le coin je serais ravi de te payer une mousse je suis pas loin plus bas dans les Alpes de Haute Provence.\nPour revenir à la disparition des filles, les appels d'urgence ayant été passé assez tôt après la dernière photo c'est a se demander si un animal par exemple un léopard ou un gars mal intentionné les avait empêchées de revenir sur leur pas ce qui aurait pu les faire s'égarer. Espérons un rebondissements car avec le temps certaines personnes peuvent se décider à parler. Salut mec !",

Je suis pas certain de bien comprendre l'intérêt de prendre les cheveux de l'une des deux jeunes femmes en photo et de la laisser sur l'appareil ? Aussi, je n'ai peut être pas bien compris mais pourquoi composer le 911 de la part de supposés agresseurs ? En effet, même en ayant connaissance que le réseau téléphonique ne passe pas, je doute que les agresseurs savaient à coup sûr que de composer le numéro des secours étaient une idée géniale : on ne sait jamais si ca capterait et se retournerait contre eux. Et dans ce cas extrêmement grave comme celui d'une séquestration, je doute que composer ce numéro serait une bonne idée. Aussi, s'ils avaient pas prévu leur mort avant l'arrivée massive des équipes de recherche : pourquoi avoir déjà prévu le plan de composer le 911 avant que les recherches ne les inquiètent ? Enfin, je ne comprends pas pourquoi ils auraient cru que le numéro d'urgence aurait été capté par les bornes téléphoniques alors qu'il n'y avait normalement pas de réseau. Je suis profane en la matière, j'imagine comme tout le monde, et je ne savais pas qu'on pouvait capter les urgences si la région très sauvage ne recevait aucun réseau. L'idée du chewing gum pour faux repère d'une jeune femme accidentée me paraît aussi trop compliquée pour deux agresseurs lambda qui se sont rendues compte sans doute avec effroi des recherches pour retrouver les deux filles. A moins que l'un d'eux avait un bon QI,  à défaut d'avoir de l'empathie, et a eu cette idée, pardonnez-moi, parfaite pour brouiller les pistes. Ca me paraît gros même si à entendre cela fait sens.",

Demandez à un urgentiste une plaie du cuir chevelu saigne beaucoup et bon courage pour enlever le sang sur les cheveux... Il faut un bon shampoing déconseillé pendant quelques jours parce que en général il y a des points de suture. Là il y a une plaie, pas de sang, pas de points de suture et des cheveux propres ??

Un détail que tu as mentionné me pose question : une source (pas forcément fiable) affirme que la femme qui a retrouvé le sac l'aurait d'abord donné au guide. Est-ce que ce détail n'aurait pas été mentionné pour justifier la potentielle présence de son empreinte dessus ? Car sinon, pourquoi lui aurait-elle donné en priorité ?",

Je pense que la photo 509 comportait effectivement le ou les coupables dessus et c'est pour ça qu'elle a été effacé. Je ne suis pas sûre que les filles ont été séquestré aussi longtemps, je pense qu'elles ont été tuées assez rapidement, leur corps découper en morceaux puis éparpillés un peu partout. Les criminels auraient juste garder les affaires des filles puis pour tromper la police étrangère ils auraient décidé de relâcher des affaires pour orienter l'enquête sur un accident... Le guide je ne sais pas quoi en penser. Est il un pion qui aurait été payée pour aider à l'enquête ou détruire des trucs... Dur à dire. Mais quelle histoire horrible. Que ces deux jeunes filles reposent en paix ❤️ merci Lionel pour cette superbe vidéo.",

Comme par hasard il retrouve plein de trucs. \nJe ne le vois pas forcément comme l'assassin (en plus son alibi est quand même sérieux) mais je pense qu'il en sait plus qu'il ne le dit par contre. En faisant son enquête il a du avoir des réponses grâce notamment aux locaux ou indigènes qu'il doit très bien connaître...\nJ'opterais donc pour le fait qu'elles aient été tuées et qu'ensuite quelqu'un a protégé les ou l'assassin en effaçant la photo compromettante. Peut-être ce guide (si ce sont des otoctones) dont l'intérêt notamment pour son business (il ne faut pas faire fuir les touristes) est de maquiller cela en accident. Ou bien, si ce ne sont pas des otoctones mais des traficants ou autres ils ont tout fait eux-même mais je reste persuadé que le guide en sait plus qu'il ne le dit... en même temps il n'a aucun intérêt à parler, pour sa sécurité personnelle également.

Votre hypothèse est très plausible, mais on ne saura peut-être jamais la vérité et c'est bien triste pour elles et leurs familles. Et comme vous j'ai pensé, avant même que vous en parliez, que la police aurait pu aider à faire disparaître la fameuse photo. Je pense aussi que le guide n'y était pour rien, juste une intution. Je ne vois pas pourquoi c'était suspect qu'il participe aux recherches étant donné qu'il était en contact avec les filles, cette affaire a dû le toucher, c'est humain. Très beau travail en tout cas de votre part, merci Lionel.",

So I believe they drank rainwater. That's the only way they could survive 11 days.\r\n\r\nTropical torrential rains can be a problem at night, when temperatures drop significantly, and biological factors determine who will get sick first. This, combined with the lack of food, weakens the body. Maybe one of them must have contracted pneumonia. Maybe Kris Kremer was alive and forgot her cell phone password\r\n\r\nEleven days alive and with a cell phone rules out foul play.\r\n\r\nAccording to the photos, after several days of torrential rain, small streams quickly become floods. I've seen it happen around here, where the water level rises rapidly, as does the current, and this swept them downstream and them drowned.\r\n\r\nI believe the cause of their deaths was actually the delay in rescue.",

Trees obscure the sun you can't tell direction. I think  they tried to find that waterfall and never found the trail again. They always say that if  you get lost, don't attempt  to find your way out. Stay put. Let them find you. There's  a good chance they would only have had to spend one night out there if they had stayed where they were once they admitted they didn't know where they were. What horrors these women went through. Rain, temps in the 50s at night. No light. No potable water. No food. Not dressed for hiking. I think Lisanne had sandals on.\nI went down down a rabbit hole on this topic after watching the extensive Daily Beast video. There are more photos that  haven't been circulated at the family's request. One is said  to be a clearer picture of Chris's head, her red hair matted with blood.",

All the geographical details beyond the Pianista trail are sketchy, the mention of a Snake River (Rio Culebra) in the area is restricted to accounts of this incident. There is however a Culebra trail in the vicinity, which adds to the confusion. It is not clear if all the locations in the photos before the final flash series were identified.\n\nThe main irritation is the different state of the backpack and the remains of the bodies. It suggests that at one point the backpack got separated from the women before their bodies were reduced to the state they were in when found. This leads to the suspicion that the backpack was not immediatly given to the authorities, was held in storage and possibly changed hands more than once.\n\nNobody talks about the cultural gap between the tourist from Europe and the local population not connected with the tourist trade. It is very probable that locals in isolated areas fear the authorities. In this case they will not volunteer information, no matter how high a reward is promised. They will act in the way they think is least likely to get them into trouble: keep quiet, keep away. They probably do not want to answer questions and get enangled in contradictions during interviews with people much more powerful than they are. So, probably the backpack was held back for quite some time and then stealthily deposited in a location sufficiently exposed that someone will come across it. Considering the state of the contents of the backpack, I do not see any ill will here.\n\nIt think, this was a sad accident while they were alone in the wilderness. A slip, a slide, a fall, a poisioning by a plant or an animal, separation, search for the friend, possibly reunification, increasing weakness, delirium ...",

They probably ventured off one trail to connect with the parallel trail so they could save time and avoid heading back down the same scenery on their way in. Photos taken at night where clearly to light the path, they wouldn't have used cell phone light to conserve battery life, also the reason they only powered on their cells twice a day. The wrong codes at the end where because lisa did not know kris's passcode,  by then lisa was trying survive kris's death. What a tradegy. I wonder if either of them attempted to climb a tall tree to get a signal or scout for a river or civilization? It's i always tell me kids to do.",

Basically it's quite unlikely that the dog went with them.\n\nEdit: Some other things that are apparently myths:\n1. Kremer's head was not injured. At least the photo doesn't suggest so. \n2. Kremer's jeans were not found neatly folded. \n3. The backpack and the things in them were quite damaged. And the indigenous woman who found it didn't go to the river for weeks until then. \n\nThere's a whole subreddit for the case. You can visit there to see more details & updates.",

        "text": "Following the life-threatening attack on Peter de Vries in July 2021, many people will have been reminded of this case, likely one of the saddest he considered.\n\nFor people who may have missed some information, the girls disappeared on a short trek in 2014 near a busy tourist village, Boquete, Panamá. They were intending to begin voluntary work in the area. Small amounts of human remains were recovered some time after they disappeared, proven to be from the girls.\n\nTheir trek was to a well-known hilltop, El Mirador Del Pianista, which took about 2 hours, starting not long after 11am and arriving at about 1pm, after a trek of about 8km. Those timings, taken from photos on a camera they had with them, were not accepted by all who reviewed the evidence, with suggestions that they may have been changed. Also, there was an assertion that the girls had earlier lost their way and only reached El Mirador Pianista at a time considerably later than the timings indicated. \n\nAfter the hilltop they continued over the other side, towards a wildlife protection zone: \ndatazone.birdlife.org; Palo Seco Protection Forest.\n\nAfter some time considering what happened and how evidence came to light, it occurred to me that the name, Protection Forest, might not mean the same to all. Open grassland, very likely a sign of cattle grazing, may indicate that an important consideration was protection of cattle and those who managed them.\n\nThe authorities may have been reluctant to say that the girls probably were attacked and killed by a jaguar or a puma. Wikipedia's pages for those predators show their distributions. Most likely, investigations were carried out by two or more different authorities, explaining many different sets of fingerprints found on their camera. What some called the monkey bridge, which consisted of cables across a gorge without planking, suggests that it was intended that people should not go into the protection zone, certainly not unless accompanied by trained guides.\n\nProbably they did not walk as far as the boundary of the protection zone. Beyond the top of the hill they were in the neighbouring province where responsibility for controlling or warning about dangerous predators might have been more uncertain.\n\nBecause of the many foreign visitors in the area where the trek began there may have been a culture of hoping for the best and not wanting to give clear warnings. Apparently, reasons to be especially fearful were not known to all but an older or weaker animal, or one wounded by poachers or ranchers, might tend to overcome an instinctive fear of humans and attack in desperation.",

Well if they are on a trail it should be normal to maybe see someone walking the same path. But the thing is after that you start to ser a lot of pictures taken by a third party, with both girls on frame, and they are not smiling anymore. There are also more deleted pictures, taken at night.\n\nThere is also the fact they hired a shady guide to take them there, that could be involved in some foul play. Especially because there is a militia living in and aroud these woods where they were found.",

I imagine one of the girls (Kris, I guess?) delirious from lack of water/illness/fever, and no longer able to insert the correct passcode to her own phone. \n\nI also Never understood why they tried calling the emergency number to a region they’re not in??! Like if I was in the UK I wouldn’t try dialing the US emergency number. Maybe under normal circumstances it would have gone through to local emergency services? I have no idea, it just always seemed weird to me and made me wonder if there was something weird with their cognition right away.",

Secondly, he was very persistent about taking the girls on the tour and staying at his ranch. Thirdly, catches wind they are missing and he just takes it upon himself to go check their hostel ? For what reason? Then leads the investigation literally right where he wanted them to go .... leading them further and further away from where the girls actually were. He took those photos on their camera on purpose to make everyone think they fell off the monkey bridge but what remains they found of the girls does not lead me to believe this was an accident.

        "text": "Guys this my theory after research the case for months: I think also the girls was not on the Pianista trail on 1st of April. Like Juan quoted there was photoshoped pics in order to give a wrong track and confusing us. I do really believe that on this day the taxi driver brought the girls to the Caldera Hot Springs in Paja de Sombrero. It was a planned kidnapping for this day after Plinio and his guys do plan days before. The cropy picture with the two guys and girls are indicating for me that they have spent that day on that location. Then they got into the car and abducted for trafficking. Wealthy guys have paid for this and the taxi driver and thet two guys know the abducter/ perpetrator. Due the high media sensation and pressure the risk was high that it come into the light, so they have decided to elimante all attendend who be a potential threat for that gang cartel. We should scope out the map and take focus on that potential area. I think we are close to solve the case. Cheers!",

I would like to see all of the pictures. If you were in this position and your friend couldnt walk? You wouldn't leave them to get help. But theres something not right. It's in my opinion that a Guide was either coming back? Didnt come back. OR Did and tried to take full advantage of the situation. I feel like someone found them. And just left. two things here, what was deleted? THE GUIDES PHOTO. Yes there was a cover up. I cant imagine going into the jungle without a guide. I think he didnt come back, when he said. Then tried to rob them. Whether the other girl was alive or not..not sure. The monkey bridge explains the bodies being scattered. SOMEONE WAS COVERING UP LIABILTY. Just my opinion. It was an injury, a liabilty, and a tragedy And someone who wanted their money.",

I wish the information I have about it was more widely available, but then again, that kind of information not requiring a couple hours of research on the deep web would upset the state of our fragile society.\n\nIn short, there are things that are incomprehensible to a regular human. These things prefer to reside in, surprise, unpopulated areas.\nJungles and Central/South Americas are full of them, hence many folk supernatural tales.\n\nThe girls stumbled upon it, I imagine that they were either \"entranced\" by an exchange of information, or were transported, perhaps event multiple times. My theory is that when they actually figured out what they were encountering, the emergency calls began. And when this entity became bored of toying with them, it literally shattered the poor girls apart.\n\nI bet they tried to take photos of what they were seeing, but you cant really snap a picture of a vision of lower/higher dimensions you are being shown. Those poor girls must have literally been losing their sanity.\n\nWhat is not as often reported is that their bodyparts and some of their belongings were also either heavily irradiated, magnetized, or had trace amounts of highly exotic chemicals on them; this is extremely common in these cases. This case would be hushed up and swept under the rugs like all others like it, but I imagine that the remoteness of the area and immediate rescue efforts prevented that.\n\nStay home, kids.\nDo not go alone or in small groups to deep wilderness.\nEspecially if the area has tales of UFO/Bigfoot/Chupacabra/vampires or whatever else cute monickers the locals came up with.",

Oder vielleicht doch, aus Bequemlichkeit, iwann haben sie die ausgezogen.....Anhand der Photos haben sie bereits welche an. Scheinbar dieselben Pushups.... wie die in dem Rucksack gepackt.....sagen auch Ermittlungen\n\nIch denke die Bhs wurden vielleicht vom Täter ausgezogen von den Frauen und in den Rucksack gepackt.\n\nWechselunterwäsche macht man ja mal, aber zweiten PushupBh einpacken für eine eher TagesWanderung ist nicht grad so eine Frauen-Marotte. Und zum eventuellen spontanen Baden würden man auch nicht sowas einpacken selber.... 🧐",

I see a blue eye on the left part of the picture - like Lisanne is holding Kris and took a picture of both of them, but Lisanne is behind or under Kris. The eye is perfect, seems to be of a person that's scared and in bad physical conditions. It would make sense. Perhaps a sort of goodbye, with Kris already dead. \nI have not seen anyone pointing out this detail. I hadn't noticed anything myself. But now it does seem to be the case.",

I am struggling to see the blood on the hair in the photo.  Light hair goes a lot darker even if it's just wet with water.  Whatever happened,  I feel so sorry for them, it will have been terrifying.  RIP girls.",

Of course the Panama people don't want to discourage tourists from coming to their area you can well understand. But just that everything was scattered it seems as if there was definitely foul Play. Who says they were the ones that took all of those photos. Maybe somebody took them to throw everyone off the path of thinking there was foul Play. Very very sad",

Or if it couldn’t do any video, take photos detailing where they were, what happened to Kris’s head and the terrain of their location in the daylight. I mean these are smart girls so why didn’t they document their experience with the Hope their families would see it. Often if someone is lost in the wilderness and succumbing to the elements they try to leave a legacy of some sort to speak to their families. \n\nIf they fell off a cliff then the backpack would have gone over the edge with them into the water but it didn’t get wet apparently. And if it was at the top of the cliff it would have been exposed to all sorts of elements, rain, heat, dirt etc. But it was clean. \n\nThose are the sticking points for me that make an accident kind of not believable.",

Knowing their time and being so intelligent talking themselves into a short cut or faster route- I’ve been there hiking it’s late/ your tired & hungry, outta water, it’s so tempting to cut out parts of the trail. It’s not fair to say they’re too smart to leave the trail. \nThe deleted photo could have been a shot of partial dressed or if they’re taking pics for orientation maybe they aimed it the wrong way and deleted so they wouldn’t become confused- lots of easy explanation.   \nIf one girl  slipped into the river canon I could see the other following to stay together. Also old tip if lost in the forest is to follow a river, so willing climb down into, it may even look easier then in a dense jungle- just seeing the sky would be uplifting. Those girls could’ve walked that river for 2 weeks or sat and waited for rescue becoming weaker by the day. If they drank the water, water born illness could have made them extremely dehydrated. Now roll an ankle or fall or hit your head. One girl dies along the way, surviving one would continue until she couldn’t. Broken bones can be explained by large predator animals or floating down the river until it gets stuck somewhere. Surviving girl probably sat her backpack somewhere safe and dry to protect the phones and camera. Wrong pins can be explained by dehydration or trying to remember her friends PIN\nThe murderer theory is juicy and tantalizing but no evidence thanks to a poorly run investigation. \nThe fact they tried emergency services that first day tells me they knew they were lost. A murderer isn’t gonna let them have their phones and call for help\nTragic all the way around. I’m so sorry for the girls and their family.",
