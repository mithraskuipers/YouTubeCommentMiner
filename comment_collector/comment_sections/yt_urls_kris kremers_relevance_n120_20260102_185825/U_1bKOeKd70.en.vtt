00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.860
On March 15, 2014, two Dutch students&nbsp;
boarded a plane from Amsterdam to Costa Rica.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.320
Like any recent graduate, 21 year old Kris&nbsp;
Kremer and 22 year old Lisanne Froon were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.120
excited students ready to see the world after&nbsp;
graduation. The two had spent a considerable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.780
amount of time saving money and wanted to&nbsp;
enjoy this vacation as a part of their gap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.342
year. When they arrived in Costa Rica, their&nbsp;
itinerary was full and they had a plan to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:27.420
enjoy themselves and integrate themselves into the&nbsp;
local communities. From Costa Rica, they continued&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.980
across the Southern border into the country of&nbsp;
Panama and made a quick stop at Bocas del Toro,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.360
near the coast before leaving for their final&nbsp;
destination, Boquete, which was further inland.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.840
If the two weren’t enjoying the&nbsp;
food, drinks, or sightseeing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.440
they would be taking Spanish lessons and&nbsp;
volunteering in a local children’s school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.240
Lisanne and Kris had both recently graduated&nbsp;
from different universities in the Netherlands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.780
where they both lived, they both kept&nbsp;
diaries, and were described as normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.720
intelligent university women looking for a nice&nbsp;
vacation to relax. Nevertheless, on March 29th,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.920
after arriving in Boquete, they settled in with a&nbsp;
host family they’d made arrangements to live with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.620
for the duration of their stay. It was also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.720
around this time that the two decided to explore&nbsp;
Boquete, we can see in pictures they took that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.880
they seemed to be having fun, visiting flower&nbsp;
markets, and going out to eat.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.160
But, one thing they hadn’t done yet was see the&nbsp;
trails and hiking areas around Boquete, so a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.080
days later, on April 1st, the two were dropped&nbsp;
off at the start of the Pianista trail by a taxi.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.140
This 8 km trail is well-known, there’s really only&nbsp;
one path to follow towards its summit although&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.980
it's said to be somewhat dangerous because of&nbsp;
its steepness and its sometimes muddy terrain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.860
Nevertheless, at around 11 am, the two&nbsp;
began their hike. Both only decided to wear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.220
a tanktop and shorts and brought a light&nbsp;
backpack with some water, their camera,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.980
and most likely some snacks indicating they were&nbsp;
expecting a short, leisurely hike. Pictures they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.660
took with their camera show that their ascent up&nbsp;
to the summit was going as planned. Although, some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.620
say that these pictures have been photoshopped&nbsp;
by a third party or the two look anxious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.660
but we’ll get to that later. For now, they’re seen&nbsp;
making their way through the forested section of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.280
the trail before finally making it to the summit,&nbsp;
where they take a string of selfies with the view.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.200
Now, the summit of the trail called El Mirador&nbsp;
is usually the spot where hikers turn around and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.060
head back towards Boquete, as there’s no other&nbsp;
trail that loops hikers back around. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.860
for some reason, pictures show that the two had&nbsp;
kept walking away from Boquete, past what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.500
called the Continental Divide and further into&nbsp;
the forest. Various sources claim that Lisanne&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.300
and Kris had researched the trail beforehand so&nbsp;
it’s unclear why they kept walking, maybe they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.840
thought that there was more nature to be seen&nbsp;
ahead, or maybe they just weren’t tired yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.460
Regardless of how the decision was made, the two&nbsp;
kept walking into what is called the “Caribbean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.560
side of Panama”. It’s been said that this side of&nbsp;
the trail is a common route for drug trafficking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.660
but others claim it's just a route where locals&nbsp;
and their cattle typically pass by. Image 505&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.580
shows Kris walking through a ravine just past the&nbsp;
summit, the location being confirmed by others who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.620
have walked the trail. A few seconds later,&nbsp;
image 506 is taken, showing the walls of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.080
ravine. And around 30 minutes after that, the last&nbsp;
two pictures are taken, depicting Kris crossing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.940
stream. Image 508 shows her looking back at the&nbsp;
camera and would be the last picture confirmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.980
to have been taken by the women. But this is the&nbsp;
point in the story where things take a dark turn.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.820
In the next 2 and half hours of the day, something&nbsp;
happened to the girls, something bad enough that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.360
they would call 112, the Dutch version of 911, at&nbsp;
4:39 pm from Kris’ iPhone, but no connection was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.640
made because of poor reception. Twelve minutes&nbsp;
later, another attempt was made to call 112,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.040
this time with Lisanne’s Samsung, but again,&nbsp;
it didn’t go through. Around an hour later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.800
both phones were powered off and in the following&nbsp;
days, 911 and 112 would be called 7 times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.320
Meanwhile in Boquete, the mother of the host&nbsp;
family, Miriam Guerra, notices that they haven’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.120
returned from their hike, however she didn’t think&nbsp;
too much of it, as students usually stay out late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.580
and enjoy Boquete’s nightlife. However the next&nbsp;
morning, on April 2nd, a tour guide that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.720
girls had previously booked an 8 am appointment&nbsp;
with, got concerned after they didn't show up.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.780
This tour guide then went to visit the house&nbsp;
where they were staying, and upon finding that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.920
they weren't there either, he notified the&nbsp;
girls’ parents in Holland. At which point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.940
the parents went to Dutch police and a few&nbsp;
hours later, the tour guide did the same in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.520
Boquete to report the missing girls. By this&nbsp;
point, small private search teams had already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.660
started looking for Kris and Lisanne, including&nbsp;
the tour guide who’d reported them missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.240
He’d also informed Sinaproc, a national civil&nbsp;
protection system, about the girls’ disappearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.180
Even on April 2, phone records show that the&nbsp;
girls’ phones were still active and being used,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.270
911 was called multiple times, Lisanne’s Samsung&nbsp;
was used to open the weather app, and curiously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.340
Kris’ iPhone 4 was used to search this up on&nbsp;
WhatsApp. It seems as if she was trying to search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.600
up the mother of the host family, Miriam, before&nbsp;
the phone is switched off without any further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.360
action. By the end of the day, Lisanne’s Samsung&nbsp;
had reached 1% and it, too, was powered off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.240
By the next day, Sinaproc had started their&nbsp;
searches on the Pianista trail and trails&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.460
surrounding it, various sources indicated that a&nbsp;
helicopter and small plane had been used to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.840
in the search, but since the Caribbean side of the&nbsp;
trail was covered in trees, it didn’t help much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.400
Searches continued throughout the next&nbsp;
few days, more volunteers were added&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.360
to search teams and more helicopters were&nbsp;
dispatched, but with no significant progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.600
However, this is when the first signs of foul play&nbsp;
are noticed, phone records would later show that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.180
on April 5th, Kris’ iPhone 4 was powered on but&nbsp;
the wrong or no passcode was put into the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.740
Over the next few days, this would happen over&nbsp;
77 times. On April 8th, 7 days after the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.000
went missing, another batch of photos would&nbsp;
be taken, now dubbed “The Nighttime Photos”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.900
The first, image 511, believed to have been taken&nbsp;
around 1:30 am, shows the forest trees looking up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.940
with droplets of some kind scattering the picture,&nbsp;
some believe this is rain, while others think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.800
water from a nearby waterfall. Now, it’s important&nbsp;
to mention that all the Nighttime Photos haven’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.460
been released to the public yet, so many chunks of&nbsp;
pictures are missing. The next photo, image 541,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.900
seems to show one of the girls, maybe their&nbsp;
chin and cheekbone, looking up, or, as some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.340
have pointed out, it could be a photo of Lisanne&nbsp;
smiling, as it matches well with a previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.980
picture of Lisanne. However, while it matches up&nbsp;
well with the edges of her face, we can see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.140
it doesn’t quite match up completely. From then&nbsp;
on, the nighttime pictures seem to just photograph&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.960
the forested area, the trees, terrain, and the&nbsp;
sky. But there are some pictures worth mentioning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.340
image 550 shows a branch with what seems to&nbsp;
be orange plastic bags tied to it. Some have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.180
theorized that this was a marker of some sort,&nbsp;
to see if the girls were going in circles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.240
Another image shows what seems to be various&nbsp;
items on a rock, a mirror, and strap of some sort,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.400
and paper, and some have said this is how the&nbsp;
girls had been trying to create an SOS sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.440
Some have even cleverly matched parts of paper in&nbsp;
this picture to other pictures taken days earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.120
for example, this piece of paper on the rock&nbsp;
matches a map that the girls had been reading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.720
days before the hike. And finally, image 580&nbsp;
shows what seems to be the back of Kris’ head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.340
although, for hair that’s been lost in the&nbsp;
forest for 7 days, it looks eerily clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.560
No head injury, blood, or even water seems&nbsp;
to have touched the hair, even though in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.140
the earlier nighttime pictures, it seems to&nbsp;
be raining. Meanwhile, private search teams,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:54.120
and Sinaproc had little luck in finding any trace&nbsp;
of the girls. And as more and more search teams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.320
had come up empty handed, people started losing&nbsp;
hope that the girls were in the forest at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.340
However, around two months after the&nbsp;
girls’ disappearance, on June 11th,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.960
it was reported in various news articles that a&nbsp;
local woman had stumbled upon the girls’ backpack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.840
down the Culebre River. It was found to be mostly&nbsp;
dry with authorities' first real clues as to what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.880
happened to the girls. In the backpack, the&nbsp;
Canon digital camera, both the girls’ phones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.480
two bras, and $88 in cash was found, among other&nbsp;
things. Although, what was odd was that despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.560
having been washed down the river for multiple&nbsp;
kilometers, the bag and its contents were found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.380
mostly undamaged. Furthermore, 13 DNA samples were&nbsp;
reported to have been taken from the backpack,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:43.260
and of those samples, actual DNA was only&nbsp;
found on three of them. It was described&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.060
as being from at least two females, two&nbsp;
males, and multiple unknowns. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:53.400
none of the DNA samples matched that of Lisanne,&nbsp;
Kris, or anyone in criminal DNA databases.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.800
Some have theorized that the girls’ DNA could have&nbsp;
been washed off in the river, meaning there’s also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:05.040
a possibility a third party’s DNA could have also&nbsp;
been washed off. Nevertheless, searchers focused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.600
on the area where the backpack was found and in&nbsp;
a few days, they began to find human remains.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.540
Shoes with bones inside of them were found, along&nbsp;
with part of a pelvic bone and a jeans short.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.340
An autopsy was then performed on the bones and&nbsp;
confirmed that the foot was of Lisanne, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.620
pelvic and jean shorts was of Kris. However, this&nbsp;
discovery led to even more unanswered questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:31.320
Autopsy of the bones inside the shoe show that&nbsp;
the foot was broken cleanly, no signs of cutting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:38.760
hacking, gunshots or teeth were found. From this,&nbsp;
the cause of death couldn’t be determined. Autopsy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.040
of Kris’ pelvic bone was even more strange as only&nbsp;
a piece of it was found. Most pelvic fractures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.080
happen during high-speed car collisions or falls&nbsp;
from great height which would imply Kris endured a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.720
powerful force. Forensic experts later found that&nbsp;
the bone had been bleached in some way and traces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.060
of phosphorus were discovered. Natural bleaching&nbsp;
from the sun or the soil is very unlikely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.440
as the level of bleaching in such a short&nbsp;
time can’t be explained from natural elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.260
In the following months, more fragmented remains&nbsp;
would be found, later confirmed to be Lisanne’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.300
tibia and femur with pieces of tissue still&nbsp;
attached, and Kris’ rib bone, also bleached.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.620
Further searches and discoveries didn’t&nbsp;
uncover much about what happened to the girls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:25.680
and only further confirmed that they were indeed,&nbsp;
dead. So, investigators turned to the evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.960
they already had, focusing on the pictures&nbsp;
first. From the image file names, it can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:37.380
seen that IMG_508 is the last daytime picture, and&nbsp;
IMG_511 is the first nighttime picture. Now, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:43.320
know IMG_510 exists but just hasn’t been released&nbsp;
to the public. However, IMG_509 can’t be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.420
When you take a picture with the Canon camera&nbsp;
that the girls were using, let’s say IMG_40,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:54.060
and delete that picture, the next picture you take&nbsp;
will fill that gap, so if IMG_509 can’t be found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.140
on the camera, it implies that someone deleted&nbsp;
the picture after the nighttime pictures were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:05.280
taken and used a computer to do it. So, where did&nbsp;
IMG_509 go? All the natural causes can mostly be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.320
dismissed, the camera couldn’t accidentally miss a&nbsp;
number and its memory card still had space. so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:16.080
prevailing theory is that someone deliberately&nbsp;
deleted IMG_509 for whatever reason. Maybe it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.600
contained incriminating evidence of a third party&nbsp;
or their real location. For now, we’ll never know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.060
Then was the issue of the nighttime photos.&nbsp;
Some believe that they were only taken to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.040
produce a flash, and act like a flashlight for&nbsp;
the lost girls. However, others have pointed out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.180
that in a lot of the pictures, the same plant&nbsp;
is photographed, meaning that the girls were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.380
staying in one spot while taking pictures.&nbsp;
In this case, flash would not be needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.900
Others have pointed out that maybe the flash was&nbsp;
used to try and signal searchers or helicopters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.340
although it’s unlikely that Sinaproc would send&nbsp;
people or helicopters in the forest at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.020
Even if they did, the flash usually doesn’t&nbsp;
get too far, as it’s blocked by rocks or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:00.120
plants. Yelling, if they could, would’ve been&nbsp;
a better way at signaling searchers. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.900
this way of thinking might be a little&nbsp;
retrospective, as the girls probably did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.120
whatever they thought would work, regardless&nbsp;
of whether it was a good idea. Maybe the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.740
were trying to show something around them, maybe&nbsp;
their location, but if that was the case, why not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.660
take pictures of more identifying features, rather&nbsp;
than mostly just the sky. And why not take a quick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.700
video with their camera or their phones? In fact,&nbsp;
some have questioned, if the girls were just lost,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.980
why they didn’t record a video explaining what&nbsp;
happened, or write a note on their phones. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.420
some pictures had been taken in the same spot, a&nbsp;
small reconstruction can be made of the landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.060
The location of the night time pictures,&nbsp;
to this day, haven’t been fully confirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.480
Theories as to what happened to the girls&nbsp;
generally fall under two categories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:51.360
the lost theory or the foul play theory. The&nbsp;
lost theory usually explains that the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.040
found themselves deep in the forest and didn’t&nbsp;
know a way out. Some say that one of the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.840
girls might have gotten injured, at which point&nbsp;
they called 911, or the other girl had left to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.120
help before meeting a similar fate. The girls did&nbsp;
come from the Netherlands and most likely didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.440
have a lot of good wilderness experience, so it&nbsp;
is possible that they had walked too far into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.360
the forest as the sun would have been setting, and&nbsp;
panic would’ve started to sink in. At that point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.060
they might’ve gotten disoriented and started&nbsp;
making irrational decisions. Authorities involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.620
in the search usually subscribe to this theory,&nbsp;
the prominent theory of Dutch investigators is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.700
that the girls had continued walking further&nbsp;
into the forest, and had tried to cross one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:34.920
of the cable bridges, where they accidentally&nbsp;
fell into the river and got swept away. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.960
this doesn’t explain how the skeletons of the two&nbsp;
girls got broken up like they did, remember that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:45.600
only the foot and leg bones of Lisanne were found,&nbsp;
and the pelvic and rib bones of Kris. Panamanian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.100
authorities initially called the disappearance a&nbsp;
homicide, but later came to a similar conclusion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:55.740
saying that the girls likely drowned in a river,&nbsp;
or were attacked by wild animals. Although, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.120
doesn’t explain all the incorrect PIN attempts&nbsp;
on the girls’ phones, how Kris’ bones ended up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.800
bleached, why searchers still haven’t found all&nbsp;
their remains, and contradicts the discovery of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.500
no teeth marks on Lisanne’s bones. Kris’ parents&nbsp;
who’ve walked the trail, have also said that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.700
there’s really only one route to take, and that&nbsp;
there’s no confusing junctions or other trails.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:29.460
The foul play theory is much more interesting. It&nbsp;
explains that the girls had run into an unknown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.140
person or group of people on or before the trail,&nbsp;
where they were then either kidnapped or killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.420
This would mean that Kris and Lisanne did not&nbsp;
meet their end through natural means. Sinaproc’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.320
leader of the search teams stated that they combed&nbsp;
through every zone of the forest where the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.600
may have ended up, over 25 trails were checked,&nbsp;
yet nothing except scattered remains were found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.800
It’s also unlikely that the girls didn’t run&nbsp;
into anyone that could’ve helped them on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.900
trail if they were lost, as the route they took is&nbsp;
frequently used by hunters, farmers, and locals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:03.120
This theory would also explain why no large&nbsp;
remains were found, the missing or deleted photos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.680
from the camera, Kris’ bleached bones, and all&nbsp;
the incorrect PIN attempts on the girls’ phones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.960
Something that supports the foul play theory is&nbsp;
the sudden and suspicious deaths of various people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.000
involved in the case. A taxi driver, who came&nbsp;
forward as the one who had picked up and brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.020
Kris and Lisanne to the start of the Pianista&nbsp;
trail, was found drowned around a year later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.900
under unexplained circumstances. According only to&nbsp;
these eyewitness statements, the story goes that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.040
after dropping off Kris and Lisanne at the&nbsp;
Pianista trail, a local gang had stopped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.120
the taxi driver and asked him where he’d&nbsp;
dropped the girls off. After telling them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.420
the gang had followed the girls and convinced&nbsp;
them to come back to their house to party,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:44.460
but when they got there, them and the girls got&nbsp;
into an altercation and the girls were killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.500
The gang then tried to cover it up by taking&nbsp;
the nighttime photos themselves and faking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.340
the phone activity, as well as trying to&nbsp;
bleach the bones to speed up decomposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.140
People who had come forward with this story&nbsp;
had also ended up dead, making it one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.900
most popular foul play theories of the case.&nbsp;
However, for this theory, all we can go on is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.920
statements from various people with no concrete&nbsp;
evidence that any of this actually happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.160
If the girls did get kidnapped, why would the&nbsp;
perpetrator let them call 911 that many times, or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.020
let them take the nighttime photos? Some have said&nbsp;
that after killing the girls, the perpetrators had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.920
likely wanted to make it look like they just&nbsp;
got lost, so they took the nighttime pictures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.940
and scattered the remains and the backpack&nbsp;
themselves so the authorities would stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.860
searching. A version of this theory states that&nbsp;
the daytime pictures could even be photoshopped,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:37.380
to conceal any third party or incriminating&nbsp;
evidence. But again, Lisanne’s foot was found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.400
to have been broken cleanly with no signs of&nbsp;
any cutting, so how could this have happened?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.280
The complex and contradicting nature of&nbsp;
this case is the reason it has captured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:53.100
public attention for so long. A disappearance,&nbsp;
documented victims themselves using a set of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.720
mysterious and cryptic photos is a case that has&nbsp;
stumped detectives and internet sleuths alike.
