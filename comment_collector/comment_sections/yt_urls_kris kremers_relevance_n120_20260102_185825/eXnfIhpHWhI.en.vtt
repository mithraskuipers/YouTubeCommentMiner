00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.466
After the

00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:00.966
backpack was

00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.000
found, Feliciano

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.400
and five

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.933
other volunteers

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.600
decided to search

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.433
the Culebra.

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:05.133
Sadly,

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:05.400
through these

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.100
searches,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.000
it was confirmed

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.500
that the girls

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.066
were no longer

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:08.533
alive.

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.466
On June 19,

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.166
Kris’s hip

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:10.700
bone and

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.400
Lisanne’s shoe

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.833
with her

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:12.900
foot still inside

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.566
it were found

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:13.900
by these

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.533
searchers.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.000
The remains

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.466
had washed up

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.066
under a tree

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.633
on the banks

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:16.866
of the

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.666
Serpent River.

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.066
The foot was

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:18.633
in an advanced

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:19.233
state of decay

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:19.733
with skin

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.400
still attached

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.700
to it.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.433
Three fractures

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:21.900
were found

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.033
in the

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:22.800
metatarsals,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.433
which are the bones

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:23.833
that connect

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:24.266
your ankle

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:24.966
to your toes.

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:25.766
And many reports

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.100
state that

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.700
Lisanne’s foot

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.100
was broken

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.300
in 28 places.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.800
But it was

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.333
really just

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:29.633
the three

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:30.300
fractures.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.900
Shortly after

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.366
this, Kris’s

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:31.766
shorts

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.200
were discovered

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.533
by a group

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.000
of searchers

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.466
floating in the

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.066
Serpent River,

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:34.400
more than

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.266
five kilometers

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:35.866
from Mirador

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:36.800
and a half mile

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.266
from where

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:37.800
the backpack

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.300
was found.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.866
One of Kris's

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:39.366
hiking boots

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:39.600
had been

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.933
discovered

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:40.600
by Feliciano

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.033
and his team

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:41.400
a few days

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.066
before they found

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:42.566
the shorts.

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.333
Her foot was

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:43.900
not inside

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.233
the boot.

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:44.533
Then on

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.300
June 25th,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.066
it was confirmed

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:46.300
that the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.866
pelvic bone

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:47.366
discovered

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.300
belonged to Kris.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.800
It had suffered

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.466
a fracture

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:49.733
that could

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.200
have been caused

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.800
by a fall,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.000
or it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.300
could have been

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.766
caused by

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.100
just the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.033
rough waters

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:53.366
of the

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.066
Serpent River.

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:54.533
A few days

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.300
later, three

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.800
more bones

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.300
were found.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.700
The bones

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.300
were parts

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.133
of Lisanne's left

00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.033
femur, tibia

00:00:59.033 --> 00:00:59.933
and left foot.
