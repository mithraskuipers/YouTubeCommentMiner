00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:10.287
In April 2014, Dutch students Kris Kremers and
Lisanne Froon went missing on a trip to Panama,

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:14.696
only for some of their belongings and
remains&nbsp;to turn up a few weeks later.

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:18.904
These fragments of evidence -
including some truly bizarre photographs

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:21.394
- appeared under inexplicable circumstances,

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:25.772
and left investigators with more
questions than answers.

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:31.320
The Kremers and Froon&nbsp;case is one of many unexplained
deaths and&nbsp;disappearances around the world that share

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.351
some unexpected commonalities, and suggest at
the influence of other anomalous phenomena.

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:40.167
[heavy typewriter keystrokes,
light chimes, typewriter return slide, ♪]

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:43.706
Kris and Lisanne, 21 and 22 years of age,

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:48.557
worked at a café-restaurant in the city
of Amersfoort in the Netherlands.

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:54.000
The women planned a trip to Panama to learn
Spanish while volunteering with local children.

00:00:54.302 --> 00:01:00.267
They flew into the island town of
Bocas del Toro on March 15th, 2014.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.360
Two weeks later, they traveled to the
small mountain town of Boquete,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.904
where they had arranged to
volunteer at a school for children.

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:13.340
They expected to return home on April 21st.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.610
The women arrived in Boquete on
March 29th, as their photos show,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.838
and they returned to their
hosts’ home before dusk.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.994
The morning of Monday March 31st, Kremers
and Froon went to the children’s school,

00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:32.376
but were told that they would have to wait
until the following week to begin volunteering.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.276
The women could not find replacement
work, so with help from staff at

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:41.501
a nearby Dutch-run language school,
they arranged some sightseeing tours.

00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:46.300
A Facebook post on March 30th
and a later text to Kris’s boyfriend

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.092
shows that the women intended to
walk around Boquete before then.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.206
Two of the staff at the language school witnessed
the pair leave town around midday on Tuesday, April 1st.

00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:03.756
Witnesses reported that Lisanne looked a bit sick.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.509
A taxi driver later reported to have
dropped the pair off around 1:40 p.m.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.673
at the beginning of the Pianista Trail.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:15.961
However, other witnesses and
timestamps on the photos

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:19.916
indicate that the hike had
begun earlier that day.

00:02:20.214 --> 00:02:26.355
Either way, Kris contacted her
boyfriend by phone around 2 p.m..

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.883
Kris and Lisanne had been wearing light
clothing and brought only a single backpack,

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:38.890
some money, a digital camera, their phones,
two water bottles, and likely a bit of food.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.020
Later, Dutch police spoke to an innkeeper who
claimed that the pair had asked him for directions

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.821
for their hike and later returned, looking
tired, asking for help getting back to town.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.738
There are conflicting eyewitness testimonies,
and it’s possible that many of these witnesses

00:02:55.738 --> 00:03:03.325
may simply be attributing memories to the
wrong day, or remembering the wrong tourists.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.040
The pair were scheduled with a local tour
guide at 8 a.m. on Wednesday April 2nd,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.000
and their absence prompted
the guide to search for them.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.583
By evening, the police and families were contacted
with help from staff at the language school.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.013
The next day, local authorities, tour
guides, and residents began foot searches,

00:03:24.013 --> 00:03:28.252
with dogs and air support arriving shortly after.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.864
Authorities distributed flyers in the area, and
news of their disappearance aired on television.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.576
Some family members and a friend of the
women traveled to Boquete to help the search.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.222
The family offered $2500 USD to anyone who could
provide an actionable tip on the pair’s whereabouts.

00:03:48.438 --> 00:03:51.712
Unfortunately, bad weather
hindered search efforts,

00:03:51.712 --> 00:03:59.177
and with no traces found after a week and a half,
officials downscaled the search on April 14th.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.160
The women's parents reached out on social
media, put up billboards, and built websites;

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.388
they even increased the reward to $40 thousand,
but all tips proved to be unhelpful.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.472
Some witnesses spoke of seeing a red
car on the day the pair went missing,

00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:18.960
but this car was never identified.

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:22.380
Later, two French tourists
claimed that on April 6th,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.109
they walked the Pianista trail and met
someone who lived on the route who told

00:04:26.109 --> 00:04:32.720
them to avoid the forest because they had
heard screaming the previous day or night.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:36.664
Kris’s family members returned to
the Netherlands by the end of April,

00:04:36.664 --> 00:04:39.961
but Lisanne’s parents arrived in May.

00:04:40.286 --> 00:04:42.248
Near the end of the month, further search

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:47.330
efforts were initiated by a team of 18 Dutch
search and rescue volunteers with 12 dogs,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.372
and later the Costa Rican Red Cross
provided 30 mountain rescuers.

00:04:52.372 --> 00:04:55.482
Nothing was found.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.697
In mid-May, an anonymous telephone
caller who declined the reward money

00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:03.970
reported seeing two bodies
near the Culubre River.

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.675
Police released a map highlighting
the spot near a river crossing,

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:12.757
but after a search of the area announced
that the tip was a false alarm.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.238
However, a report by the The Star of Panama
claimed that helicopter radar detected

00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:23.712
skeletons but, due to the weather and difficult
conditions, officials were unable to recover them.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.797
The women’s remains were discovered
the following month in the same area.

00:05:27.797 --> 00:05:31.334
[heavy typewriter keystrokes,
light chimes, typewriter return slide, ♪]

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:35.462
On June 11th - nearly ten weeks since
the women’s disappearance -

00:05:35.462 --> 00:05:40.425
an indigenous farmer was working by a river
around the village of Alto Romero when she spotted

00:05:40.425 --> 00:05:46.359
a backpack near or in a river roughly 8
hours walking distance north of Boquete.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.685
The backpack contained Froon’s passport, an
insurance card, a digital camera, the women’s

00:05:52.685 --> 00:06:03.179
cell phones, $83 in U.S. cash, sunglasses, two
folded bras, and an empty plastic water bottle.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.280
The backpack was discovered in an area previously
searched by the middle of April, but authorities

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:15.840
claimed that sniffer dogs had been prevented
from searching there due to dangerous conditions.

00:06:16.051 --> 00:06:22.712
During a press conference on June 19th, Panamanian
prosecutor Betzaïda Pittí Cerrud announced that

00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:27.549
residents of Alto Romero had discovered human
remains in a dense, wooded area along the upper

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:33.670
part of the Culubre River, roughly five kilometers
from the pair’s last known hiking location.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.751
The items were scattered over a fairly large area.

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:43.639
They included Kris’s left pelvic bone and one
of Lisanne’s shoes with the laces done up.

00:06:43.815 --> 00:06:48.250
Inside was a sock and some remains of her foot.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.982
Also found here were Kris’s jean
shorts and a boot that matched

00:06:51.982 --> 00:06:54.921
the brand and condition of the
ones that Kris had been wearing;

00:06:54.921 --> 00:07:01.796
however, this boot was blue instead of brown,
and investigators chose not to test it for DNA.

00:07:02.143 --> 00:07:04.617
This area had also been searched previously,

00:07:04.617 --> 00:07:11.740
but again, authorities claimed difficult terrain
had prevented the dogs from searching there.

00:07:12.157 --> 00:07:19.447
At the end of July, 2014, Kris’s parents returned
to Panama and walked the Pianista trail.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.641
Search efforts by locals found more of the
women’s bones on July 30th and August 2nd,

00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:28.507
including one of Kris’s rib bones.

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:32.160
Later forensic testing revealed all
of Kris' bones had traces of

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.220
phosphorus, resulting in white discoloration.

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:40.225
This can result from sun exposure
or from chemicals in the ground,

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:44.298
but the necessary phosphates
aren’t present in the local soil.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:51.925
Tests on the other bones showed no
signs of trauma, fractures, or illness.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.680
In August, the Kremer’s family
representative filed a complaint

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.678
against the Panamanian prosecution,
accusing them of mishandling the investigation.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.094
Shortly after, the Kremers family discovered
that the Netherlands Forensic Institute

00:08:06.094 --> 00:08:10.377
had failed to pass on information
to the Panamanian authorities.

00:08:10.702 --> 00:08:14.163
Later, Kris’s parents revealed that
DNA from an unknown person

00:08:14.163 --> 00:08:17.411
was found on the recovered backpack,
and that information from

00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:22.841
Panamanian authorities indicated
that the women had been kidnapped.

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:25.709
One newspaper wrote that a
fingerprint found on one of the

00:08:25.709 --> 00:08:29.990
recovered phones was in the Panamanian 
database, but Panamanian authorities

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:36.145
did not obtain fingerprints from searchers
who would have handled the evidence.

00:08:36.468 --> 00:08:41.100
At the end of August, locals found
more remains along the Culubre river:

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.446
two of Lisanne’s leg bones,
and a piece of skin from her leg.

00:08:45.663 --> 00:08:48.423
Forensic testing determined
that the skin tissue was in

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:53.394
unusually good condition for the
almost five months that she was missing.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.139
There were 33 scattered bones
and fragments recovered in all,

00:08:57.139 --> 00:09:05.350
and strangely, DNA testing found that a number
belonged to three different unknown victims.

00:09:05.543 --> 00:09:10.375
In September, the camera and phone
cases were tested for biological traces,

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:15.919
and Lisanne’s remains were investigated
by the Netherlands Forensic Institute.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.660
The Institute’s investigators released
their autopsy report on September 19th,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.079
and Pittí Cerrud concluded that
Kris and Lisanne died 8 days

00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:29.137
after they went missing, likely
taken by the “swollen river.”

00:09:29.408 --> 00:09:32.247
The lackluster investigation
efforts suggest to some that

00:09:32.247 --> 00:09:38.733
officials in Panama wanted to cover-up
the case to protect the tourist industry.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.400
With support from donations, a team of forensic
specialists was sent to Boquete in early January,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:51.610
2015, made up of members of a Dutch dog
rescue team and a few Panamanian authorities.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.482
The forensic specialists reviewed
all plausible scenarios, and walked

00:09:55.482 --> 00:10:01.144
the Pianista trail to the Culubre River
where the items and remains were found.

00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:05.322
The specialists concluded that becoming
lost on the trail was implausible,

00:10:05.322 --> 00:10:09.798
and that the possibility of encountering
crime was “highly unlikely.”

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.400
They leaned towards a fatal accident, with the
team-leader stating that the end of the trail

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.745
had “slopes” leading to the river that
the women could have fallen down.

00:10:19.097 --> 00:10:23.590
However, this accident theory was
contested by many outside parties,

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:28.496
and it doesn’t explain the sudden appearance of
the womens’ remains in a previously searched area.

00:10:28.496 --> 00:10:31.903
[heavy typewriter keystrokes,
light chimes, typewriter return slide, ♪]

00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:38.545
A wealth of evidence was found on the women’s devices,
though it didn’t offer any resolution to the mystery.

00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:44.609
On April 1st, Kris made an emergency phone
call from an unknown location at 4:39 p.m.,

00:10:44.609 --> 00:10:47.084
but no connection was made.

00:10:47.219 --> 00:10:51.168
Lisanne attempted another call 12 minutes later.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.553
At 6:58 a.m. the next day, an attempt was made
to call an emergency number from Lisanne's phone,

00:10:57.553 --> 00:11:01.690
with another attempt using
Kris’s over an hour later.

00:11:01.989 --> 00:11:06.208
The phones were turned on and off again
several more times in the following days,

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:12.272
with two more attempted 911 calls
from Kris’s phone on April 3rd.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.095
The second time that someone tried using
Kris’s phone on April 5th, the user entered

00:11:17.095 --> 00:11:23.599
the wrong PIN code, or failed to enter one
at all, causing the phone to stay locked.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.521
The next day, around the same times
as the previous days’ attempts,

00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:33.238
there were two more incorrect PIN entries,
and several more in the following days.

00:11:33.462 --> 00:11:39.220
The phone was turned off for
good at 11:56 a.m. on April 11th.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:45.900
After the women’s camera was recovered on June
11th, many of their photos were leaked online.

00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:50.880
By the timeline set by authorities, at
least 33 photos were taken April 1st

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.896
showing the pair on the Pianista trail,
reaching the summit and going beyond it.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.000
The next photo to be taken
was completely deleted,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.284
and after that, their camera went
unused for the next seven days.

00:12:05.473 --> 00:12:09.600
Only 51 of the remaining 100 photos
taken were leaked to the public,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.596
though it’s possible that the remaining
49 photos were completely dark.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.048
All but one of the leaked photos were taken
in the middle of the pair’s seventh night missing

00:12:19.048 --> 00:12:29.500
- April 8th - between 1:29 to 3:22 a.m.,
local time, with the last image taken at 4:10 a.m..

00:12:29.838 --> 00:12:35.577
Like the phone data, these so-called
“night photos” only raise more questions.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.851
All of the photos were edited in
some way - most were brightened,

00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:43.110
or had their camera settings data deleted.

00:12:43.299 --> 00:12:48.162
Most appear to be taken with a
flash and contain some rainfall.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.120
The majority show the same surrounding
foliage from different angles,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.190
enabling analysts to overlay them.

00:12:55.488 --> 00:12:58.101
The fact that so many flash
photos were taken pointed

00:12:58.101 --> 00:13:01.729
straight up at the same break in the
tree cover suggests that the pair were

00:13:01.729 --> 00:13:07.164
attempting to signal to would-be rescuers,
although no searches were conducted at night.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.779
Other photos suggest that the women were
using the flash to orient themselves.

00:13:14.077 --> 00:13:18.322
A few images stand out, notably image 550,

00:13:18.322 --> 00:13:23.169
which shows red shopping bags
tied to a branch on a large rock.

00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:28.336
Image 580 is especially unusual,
being a well exposed and focused shot

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:35.466
of what could be the back of Kris’ head - her hair
somehow perfectly dry and almost free of debris.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.223
Another standout photo is image 509,
because it was deleted from the memory card.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.935
Normally when a photo is “deleted” from a
camera, the image remains on the memory card

00:13:46.935 --> 00:13:54.366
until it’s overwritten, suggesting that someone
must have used outside software to remove it.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.823
Independent analysts have pointed out that the
digital camera’s date and time settings were

00:13:58.823 --> 00:14:04.966
off by a year, meaning authorities could
have recalibrated the times incorrectly.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.852
It’s also been argued that at least some
of the times or filenames are incorrect.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.279
A private investigator close to the Kremers
family known only to the public as V.,

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:20.840
came to believe that the final photos of the
pair walking the trail were taken the day prior,

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:26.741
on March 31st, and that the perpetrators
changed photo data to April 1st.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.666
This might explain why some testimonies
conflict with the official timeline.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.773
In October 2015, writer and journalist,
Ramón Hernández, published a book compiling

00:14:39.773 --> 00:14:46.751
Panamanian news articles and photos released
between April 29th, 2014, and the book’s publication.

00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:51.418
He argued that the
circumstances pointed to a crime.

00:14:51.675 --> 00:14:56.389
In 2022, Venezuelan-American
journalist, Mariana Atencio,

00:14:56.389 --> 00:15:03.509
traveled to Boquete to reinvestigate the
case with Daily Beast reporter Jeremy Kryt.

00:15:03.807 --> 00:15:06.784
Locals were reluctant to speak
about the disappearances,

00:15:06.784 --> 00:15:13.869
but the team discovered that there are over 50 missing
women and girls in that area since 2009 alone.

00:15:14.169 --> 00:15:16.954
The team also made allegations
of government corruption,

00:15:16.954 --> 00:15:23.830
possible drug trafficking, and even
human trafficking and organ harvesting.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.740
To further complicate the investigation, a
low-resolution photo emerged from an unknown

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:34.521
source which may or may not show Kris and
Lisanne swimming topless with two men.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.120
Needless to say, there is no consensus
on what happened to Kris and Lisanne.

00:15:39.334 --> 00:15:42.900
[heavy typewriter keystrokes,
light chimes, typewriter return slide, ♪]

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.793
Kremers &amp; Froon weren’t the only
tourists to go missing in the area.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:53.344
In 2009, Alex Humphrey, a 29-year-old British
man disappeared from the town of Boquete,

00:15:53.344 --> 00:15:58.473
leaving everything behind except his
passport, credit card, and money.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.348
Locals in the area have also met unexpected
ends, like 22-year-old Osman Valenzuela from

00:16:04.348 --> 00:16:09.699
Alto Boquete who died shortly after
Kremers’ and Froon’s disappearance.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.239
While his death looked like a drowning,
the autopsy found no water in his lungs.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.485
It’s a near certainty that Osman
is one of the two men featured

00:16:18.485 --> 00:16:21.535
in the photo with the
two female swimmers.

00:16:21.725 --> 00:16:27.125
The other man in the photo was killed
the following year in a traffic accident.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.224
Most worrisome, the last taxi driver to
drop Kris and Lisanne off on April 1st,

00:16:32.224 --> 00:16:37.267
Leonardo Arturo González, was found
drowned the following year on March 2nd,

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:43.050
after he had just been seen
waiting nearby for some passengers.

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:48.011
Globally, a disturbingly high number
of people go missing every year.

00:16:48.322 --> 00:16:55.518
Over 600,000 people go missing annually in the
U.S. alone, though many of these are later found.

00:16:55.902 --> 00:16:59.446
While the Kremers and Froon
disappearance is unusual in many ways,

00:16:59.446 --> 00:17:04.131
it fits several patterns observed in
missing persons cases around the world.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.100
These patterns are researched most
prominently by retired police officer,

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:14.634
David Paulides, who’s produced several books
and documentaries under his Missing 411 series.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:18.913
Paulides highlights over a dozen
standout traits or “profile points”

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:23.778
that he’s identified as being present in
many of the unexplained disappearances.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:31.613
For example, many disappearances happen
in rural settings; often deep in the wilderness.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.625
Search dogs can’t track a scent
from the scene of the disappearance.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:44.110
In cases where the victim returns, they often lack
memory of the events, or describe “missing time.”

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.454
In cases where the victim dies, the body
is often found with some apparel missing

00:17:49.454 --> 00:17:54.319
- often their boots - despite a thorough
search of the area, and frequently in a spot

00:17:54.319 --> 00:17:58.362
previously explored many times by searchers.

00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:03.935
Often, too, the body turns up
in or near a source of water.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:09.038
Paulides also noted that it was usual for
large bones to be missing from the bodies.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:17.190
For example, 48-year-old Robert Springfield from
Montana went missing September 19th, 2004.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.799
The former Marine had gone out on a bow-hunting
trip with his 13-year-old son in the Bighorn Mountains,

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:28.349
an area he was very familiar with,
but he failed to return to the meeting spot.

00:18:28.569 --> 00:18:31.066
Search efforts recovered nothing.

00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:36.565
What remained was found October, 2005:
a partial skull and a femur next to a

00:18:36.565 --> 00:18:42.000
“neatly” rolled belt, two boots,
a coat, and his untouched wallet.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.203
Only his bow and arrows were missing.

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:52.037
The remains were just 50 yards from the
camp where searchers focused their efforts.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.625
In his 2012 book, Missing 411, Paulides
stated that he had been presented with at

00:18:57.625 --> 00:19:03.926
least six “viable hypotheses” to account for the
phenomenon, but didn’t detail what these were.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.801
He stated only that there are “too many
consistent elements present in the majority

00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:12.135
of cases for this to be mere coincidence.”

00:19:12.487 --> 00:19:15.182
In recent years, however, he’s suggested that

00:19:15.182 --> 00:19:22.152
these disappearances may be related to other
anomalous experiences and entity encounters.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.650
Paulides’ latest documentary explores
the connection with the UFO phenomenon,

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:32.113
and he suggests that many missing persons cases
may have begun like other UFO abduction stories,

00:19:32.113 --> 00:19:35.219
but differed in that the
victims were not returned.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.621
In other words, what we know as UFO abduction
experiences may simply be aborted missing

00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:47.397
persons cases, where the experiencer, for whatever
reason, was returned to their place of capture.

00:19:47.715 --> 00:19:53.633
For Example, Paulides brings up the Carl
Higdon abduction of 1974, in which Carl

00:19:53.633 --> 00:19:59.220
was apparently taken aboard a spaceship after
meeting a strange entity on an elk hunt.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.590
Higdon was told that he was not
suitable for his abductors’ purposes,

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:10.564
which he took to mean that he’d had
a vasectomy, and couldn’t procreate.

00:20:10.995 --> 00:20:14.693
Several cases suggest the
presence of a cryptid.

00:20:14.693 --> 00:20:22.020
For example, in late January of 2019, in Craven
County, North Carolina, 3-year-old Casey Hathaway

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.860
disappeared into the woods, surviving
freezing and near-freezing conditions

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:31.701
for over two days until he was found just a
quarter mile from his last known location.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.295
According to the family, Casey said that “his
best friend the bear was with him to keep

00:20:36.295 --> 00:20:42.878
him safe” during the two days, though all bears
should have been hibernating at that time.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.221
Paulides also reports that “dozens” of
North American indigenous peoples he’s

00:20:47.221 --> 00:20:51.475
interviewed state that "Little People"
living in the forests regularly harass,

00:20:51.475 --> 00:20:56.680
kidnap, and steal,
but it’s rare to ever see one.

00:20:57.022 --> 00:21:01.692
Ufologist Jacques Vallée has drawn on the work
of scholars of European folklore to show that

00:21:01.692 --> 00:21:09.453
Medieval Europeans believed the same things about
fairies, Lutins, Kobolds, and other mythical beings.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.869
In fact, nearly all cultures
of the world have traditions

00:21:12.869 --> 00:21:16.793
of some wild creature or spirit
taking people away to kill them.

00:21:16.793 --> 00:21:20.173
[heavy typewriter keystrokes,
light chimes, typewriter return slide, ♪]

00:21:20.173 --> 00:21:24.504
There are so many highly unusual elements
in the disappearance of Kremers and Froon

00:21:24.504 --> 00:21:28.063
that no single explanation
can account for them all.

00:21:28.198 --> 00:21:31.500
At the same time, however,
the case contains many elements

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.531
that fit with a larger pattern of unexplained
deaths and disappearances around the world.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.267
Some of these missing persons cases, at least,

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:47.353
may also overlap with other anomalous phenomena,
including fairies, cryptids, and even UFOs.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.490
