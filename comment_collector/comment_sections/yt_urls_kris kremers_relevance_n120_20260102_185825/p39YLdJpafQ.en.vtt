00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.820
Among the clouds: The disappearance&nbsp;
of Lisanne Froon and Kris Kremes

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.100
It is said that in the “Pianista” trail,&nbsp;
near the town of Boquete in Panama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.560
one can walk among the clouds. The&nbsp;
trail is located at the Continental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.200
Divide that traverses all of the landmass&nbsp;
of the American continent, dividing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.320
into two hydrological systems, draining to&nbsp;
either the Pacific or the Atlantic oceans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.920
The extreme humidity and altitude make it&nbsp;
a relatively challenging trail, with lots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.920
of lush vegetation and animal life. Some parts&nbsp;
of it are also affected by yearly flash floods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.220
At the summit of the trail, the “Mirador”, there&nbsp;
is a small sign warning about going further down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.680
the trail, towards the opposite site of where&nbsp;
it being next to the “ll Pianista” restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.320
It advises tourists to not continue without a&nbsp;
guide or a local companion. Before 2014, there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.500
was no sign at the summit. Another newer addition&nbsp;
to the trail is a small memorial, a red cross with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.660
two names written on it: Lisanne Froon and Kris&nbsp;
Kremers. These young dutch women disappeared on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:23.400
the “Pianista” trail while on a holiday in Panama&nbsp;
in 2014. The case made international headlines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.560
and shook both the Netherlands and Panama to&nbsp;
their core. But what do we know about what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.160
happened to Lisanne and Kris? Only parts of their&nbsp;
bodies and some of their supplies were recovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.580
Could there have been some foul play involved?&nbsp;
Or were they unfortunate victims of nature?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.040
Lisanne and Kris

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.180
Lisanne Froon and Kris Kremers both grew up&nbsp;
in Amersfoort, a picturesque medieval town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.980
in Central Netherlands. Lisanne was 22, she had&nbsp;
studied Applied Psychology, and is described by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.040
The Foundation set up by her and Kris’s loved&nbsp;
ones as adaptable, inquisitive and thoughtful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.480
as well as sporty and a fan of volleyball. Kris&nbsp;
was slightly younger than Lisanne, at 21, and had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.100
studied Cultural Social Education, specializing&nbsp;
in Art Education at the University of Utrecht.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.340
The Foundation describes Kris as creative,&nbsp;
aspiring and really passionate about art and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.140
education. On March 15, 2014, both women boarded&nbsp;
a plane in Amsterdam, headed towards Panama. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.000
had saved for six months to travel to the Central&nbsp;
American country, where they hoped to get to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.060
the natural landscape and the local people, and&nbsp;
had arranged to volunteer at a local rural school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.660
They also wanted to learn Spanish. A week&nbsp;
before their trip they had become roommates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.140
while also working at the same Café. The trip&nbsp;
was also a celebration for Froon’s graduation.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.780
After some sightseeing and traveling around&nbsp;
the country for a couple of weeks, they arrived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.920
in Boquete, a small town in the Panamanian green&nbsp;
highlands, near the Baru Volcano. In recent years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.160
the town has become a prominent sightseeing spot,&nbsp;
and a popular retirement place for older people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.880
from Europe and North America because of its cool&nbsp;
climate and beautiful natural surroundings and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.300
hiking trails. One of such trails is called&nbsp;
“El Pianista”, spanish for “The Pianist”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.920
Once Lisanne and Kris arrived in&nbsp;
Boquete to their host family’s house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.900
they headed towards the school where they had&nbsp;
volunteered to help the local children. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.000
they found out that the school didn’t want any&nbsp;
volunteers that didn’t speak fluent Spanish,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.640
in spite of the fact that they had received&nbsp;
confirmation from the school some days prior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.860
about the volunteer program. They were supposed&nbsp;
to stay there for the better part of a month.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.100
Throughout their first weeks in Panama, the&nbsp;
pair kept a diary and also wrote continuously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.680
to their parents and family, and in the case of&nbsp;
Lisanne to her boyfriend back in the Netherlands.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.500
Kris and Lisanne expressed their disappointment&nbsp;
about the volunteer work to their loved ones, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.080
also quickly started searching for other places&nbsp;
where they could volunteer in and around town,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.140
finding a couple of possibilities. They also&nbsp;
both mentioned they were going hiking to “El&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.840
Pianista”. From several eyewitness accounts, it&nbsp;
seems the young women started their hike around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.460
2pm on April 1st, 2014. The same accounts claim&nbsp;
they took a local dog with them, named “Azul”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.040
which is the Spanish word for blue. Azul&nbsp;
was the pet of the owners of “Il Pianista”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.680
a restaurant near the beginning of the trail&nbsp;
specialized in Italian cuisine. Some witnesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.520
claimed that they had warned Lisanne&nbsp;
and Kris about hiking the trail alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.500
but it seems the trail wasn’t&nbsp;
particularly known as a dangerous hike.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.400
The disappearance and its aftermath

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.220
Whatever shape these warnings about the trail&nbsp;
took place, the women apparently waved them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.400
aside and went on with their hike. Many hours&nbsp;
later, Azul would come back from the cloudy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.120
paths of “El Pianista” alone. On April the 2nd,&nbsp;
alarms would start to go off from the locals who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.820
had met the women, including their host family,&nbsp;
a guide they had scheduled to meet the next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.180
and the owners of Il Pianista. Some days later,&nbsp;
the women’s parents would arrive in Panama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.520
with Dutch investigators coming along with&nbsp;
them, and a massive search would start to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.940
fruitlessly try to find Lisanne and Kriss. The&nbsp;
investigation would continue, but their families,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.760
heartbroken, would head back home without&nbsp;
finding answers, at least for a while.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:57.000
A couple of months later, on June 11th, a blue&nbsp;
lycra backpack was found at the edge of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.180
Culebra River in the Changuinola Province, more&nbsp;
than 15km from where the young women were last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:10.980
seen. Inside, two mobile phones, undergarments,&nbsp;
two pairs of sunglasses, a key and 88 dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.460
in cash were found. Also in the backpack: an&nbsp;
international insurance license for Lisanne.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.400
The finding of the backpack sent the investigation&nbsp;
teams into full gear around the area where it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.280
found. Much has been speculated about the possible&nbsp;
mishandling of the investigation regarding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.060
backpack and further findings, especially in&nbsp;
terms of forensics. 13 DNA samples were taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.600
from the backpack by the Panamanian police.&nbsp;
From this, DNA was found in 3 of them, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.820
identified as belonging to two different women and&nbsp;
a man. None of these were matched with a person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:54.120
not even with Kris or Lisanne. A further Dutch&nbsp;
forensic team analyzed the backpack and its items,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.660
but no DNA evidence was reported. Although many&nbsp;
fingerprints were apparently found, none of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.060
could be matched, and it was reported that some of&nbsp;
the evidence was accidentally contaminated by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.240
local police who handled the items originally. It&nbsp;
was reported at one point that one fingerprint had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.300
matched a Panamanian database, but the information&nbsp;
was not confirmed. Throughout the trail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.240
both Panamanian and international newspapers&nbsp;
grasped at straws to keep the case in the news,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.320
so a lot of conflicting reports&nbsp;
exist from contemporary sources.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.680
After the backpack, suddenly some bones started&nbsp;
to appear most of them in the same general area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.680
as the bag, down near the Culebra river, at&nbsp;
least a 15 hour walk from where the women were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.080
last spotted. The Panamanian authorities&nbsp;
speculated that the remains had floated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.080
downriver after the women had an unfortunate&nbsp;
accident. But not everything seems to add up.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.700
Most of the bones found were completely&nbsp;
dry, without tissues or fat. Some of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:05.400
did have some tissue remaining, pointing to an&nbsp;
extremely different timeline of decomposition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.260
and according to some reports not really&nbsp;
matching with bones being a lot of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:17.100
surrounded by water in any case. Decomposition&nbsp;
rates can vary according to a lot of factors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.760
so the authorities theory&nbsp;
couldn’t be completely discarded.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:27.420
One finding that baffled most of the investigation&nbsp;
team was the condition of one of Kris’s bones.&nbsp;

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:33.480
It had white discoloration, seemed almost&nbsp;
bleached. Several theories were advanced to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.760
how this could’ve happened naturally. Some&nbsp;
experts at the time claimed that maybe the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.980
bones were "exposed to the sun for a long&nbsp;
time or that the burial site corresponded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.660
to an area of ​​very basic chemical&nbsp;
elements, affecting the phosphates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:54.240
and calcium carbonates from each of the bone&nbsp;
components, causing the whitish coloration."

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.960
No cause of death could be&nbsp;
concluded from the bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:06.180
Even later apparently some skin tissue was found&nbsp;
unattached to anything, muddying every theory yet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:12.360
again. The remain barely had animal markings,&nbsp;
and some bones had root markings, which occur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:18.420
when rootlets invade the bones after death,&nbsp;
complicating the possible timeline yet again.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.380
The investigation and the known facts

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:29.400
Several possible avenues were followed by the&nbsp;
authorities concerning the possibility of foul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.280
play. One of the possible clues found at the time&nbsp;
was a photograph taken from the phone of a local,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:42.420
which, though in a really low resolution, shows&nbsp;
two young men and women, with the women fitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.100
roughly the profiles of Lisanne and Kris.&nbsp;
According to the metadata of the photo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:53.100
it was taken the day of the women’s dissapearence.&nbsp;
The Panamanian investigators later concluded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.620
that the women in the picture were neither&nbsp;
Lisanne nor Kris, but never publicly said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:04.500
how they came to this conclusion, neither&nbsp;
identified who these women were instead.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.200
A lot of the speculation and investigation after&nbsp;
the finding of the belonging and remains was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.320
related to the women’ phones and camera, to try&nbsp;
to reconstruct a timeline of what happened once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.440
they were in the Pianista trail, and possibly&nbsp;
what went wrong. These are the generally agreed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:28.140
upon known facts of what happened to them from&nbsp;
the evidence found on the phones and camera:

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:34.440
Lisanne and Kris embarked on El Pianista&nbsp;
on the 1st of April around lunchtime.&nbsp;

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.000
Subsequent photos found on the camera&nbsp;
match images from the summit of the trail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.740
so we know they reached the summit and&nbsp;
appeared to be mostly in good spirits.&nbsp;

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:49.680
Further photos from camera taken on the same&nbsp;
first day appear to be from further down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.140
trail, after the continental divide, but&nbsp;
haven’t been matched 100% to the area.&nbsp;

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.720
The phone’s records show the women tried to&nbsp;
contact an emergency number from the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:07.140
day afternoon, way before dark, according to their&nbsp;
phone logs. From then on their phones were barely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:13.320
used for days, maybe to save battery power.
The girl’s camera was used again on April&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.080
8th to take pictures in the dark for a few hours&nbsp;
during the early morning. It is not clear where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.120
these photos were taken, but a lot of them&nbsp;
capture really similar angles of the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:30.600
places. One of the photos shows apparently&nbsp;
blonde/reddish hair from an unknown angle.&nbsp;

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.240
After one of the phones ran out of battery,&nbsp;
another was turned on and off several times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.240
and after a few times the PIN either wasn’t&nbsp;
entered correctly or wasn’t entered at all.&nbsp;

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.520
The whole Pianista area and the surroundings&nbsp;
were sweeped some days after the women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.160
disappeared. If the timeline with the camera&nbsp;
stands then they were alive up to the 8th of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.040
April but weren’s found by the rescue teams.
Their remains started to appear more than two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.180
months after the women disappeared,&nbsp;
some up to five months later.&nbsp;

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.100
Mostly fragments of bones and skin were&nbsp;
recovered, a lot of them suspiciously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.500
well preserved or in the case of Kris’s&nbsp;
bones, in an otherwise unusual condition.&nbsp;

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:19.920
The handling of the case by Bethsaida Pitti and&nbsp;
the Panamanian authorities has been criticized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.140
both in Panama and the Netherlands, and&nbsp;
in several publications across the globe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:31.080
Some of the main issues are related to poor&nbsp;
handling of evidence, and rushing to conclusions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:37.680
without fully looking into all possibilities. The&nbsp;
photos found in the SD card were edited to try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.740
make them “more visible”. One photo was missing&nbsp;
from the camera roll, as the camera count skipped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.800
one number, which usually indicated an image was&nbsp;
eliminated when more photos were taken after it.&nbsp;

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.240
After some further investigation and&nbsp;
under pressure to come up with answers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.000
the Panamanian authorities concluded the&nbsp;
women likely died in an accident near some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.820
well known “monkey bridges”, that are known&nbsp;
to be dangerous. Although no foul play was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:11.280
concluded to have happened by the authorities,&nbsp;
dozens of both professional and amateur sleuths,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:17.460
journalists and otherwise interested parties&nbsp;
have kept the case alive for almost a decade.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.280
Occam’s Razor

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.940
We will now analyze some of the main&nbsp;
theories regarding what could have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.400
happened to Lisanne And Kris, and apply&nbsp;
the principle of Occam’s Razor to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.980
We will try to find the explanation that&nbsp;
required the smallest amount of assumptions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:41.400
or of unknown information, as Occam’s Razor&nbsp;
posits that this is the most likely outcome.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.880
The Accident theory: They fell down from&nbsp;
the monkey bridges and into the river:&nbsp;

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.740
This theory checks out with where&nbsp;
the bones were found, downriver,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.460
and with some but not all of&nbsp;
the conditions of the bones.&nbsp;

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:02.760
Some individual bones found exactly next to&nbsp;
each other, 14 hours down stream from where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.680
the accident could have happened. It is really&nbsp;
unlikely the bones would be found like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.720
but still possible. Other bones and&nbsp;
remains were found in places further away.&nbsp;

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:20.040
The belonging and clothes were found in relatively&nbsp;
good condition, with low to no water damage. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:24.840
also seems relatively unlikely, but the&nbsp;
phones, for example, were found inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.500
a sealed ziplock, which explains their status.
The phones and camera records would seem indicate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:37.020
that they were active several days after they&nbsp;
left, lost, but the searches that took place for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:42.180
weeks did not find them. It is possible they&nbsp;
were still walking for days without running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:48.060
into anyone from the search, but unlikely.
There are some assumptions we need to make,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.800
but some of the evidence does seem to&nbsp;
point towards this theory as a solution.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:59.220
The Foul Play Theory: Someone found them&nbsp;
on the trail, kidnapped and murdered them.&nbsp;

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.080
One of the strongest arguments for the&nbsp;
Foul Play theory is the weird behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.540
and patterns with the phones and cameras, along&nbsp;
with their mysterious appearance months later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.660
It is plausible that the women continued&nbsp;
to use their phones sporadically, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:21.060
seems strange that they mostly didn’t unlock&nbsp;
them nor attempt constant emergency calls.&nbsp;

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.640
The photos with the camera are completely&nbsp;
unexplained, though some have speculated that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.620
if it was really them, they could’ve been trying&nbsp;
to keep an animal away with the flash photos.&nbsp;

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:37.200
Another argument for the foul play theory&nbsp;
is that a full sweep of the area after they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:44.040
went missing found no trace of them, but some&nbsp;
photos are of days later. Again, is it possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.380
they were simply not found, but the searches&nbsp;
were really extensive through several weeks.&nbsp;

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:55.440
There is apparently one missing photo number in&nbsp;
the camera, according to the automatic numeration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:01.380
of the photos. This would seem to indicate&nbsp;
that a photo was eliminated after further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.840
photos were taken. This numbered photo would&nbsp;
be exactly between the last photos from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:12.960
day the women went missing, and the first photos&nbsp;
taken at night on April 8th. Though we can’t know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.980
conclusively who deleted the photo or why, it is&nbsp;
suspicious that exactly that photo is missing.&nbsp;

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:26.340
Amongst the remains, there were no signs of foul&nbsp;
play, like the use of firearms or sharp objects,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:32.400
found. Although this complicates coming to any&nbsp;
conclusion regarding foul play, it is difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:38.220
also to confirm the alternative, the accident,&nbsp;
since so little of the bodies was recovered.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:45.120
Both the Accident and the Foul Play theory require&nbsp;
us to assume several things we don’t know about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.820
the timelines of the events and the evidence found&nbsp;
and missing. The main thing that would lead us to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:56.580
believe the Accident Theory more easily is that&nbsp;
we don’t have to assume the involvement of a third&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:03.060
party, and we haven’t been able to conclusively&nbsp;
identify a third party for the Foul Play Theory.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.100
However, there is some speculation&nbsp;
about a potential third party involved,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:14.700
which could blow the case wide open again and lead&nbsp;
the investigators towards the Foul Play theory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.680
and the most recent developments&nbsp;
revealed in November of 2022.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.020
The newest findings

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:28.260
In a recent podcast by Mariana Atencio&nbsp;
and Jeremy Kryt about the disappearance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.900
they go through the whole case, analyzing it&nbsp;
from every angle, even traveling to Boquete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.520
and traversing the Pianista Trail. On the&nbsp;
sixth and final episode of the podcast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:43.680
they interview Margarita, the mother of&nbsp;
one of the the young men that appeared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.360
in a photo with a pair of women that&nbsp;
some speculated were Lisanne and Kris.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:54.780
The owner of the phone that took the photo,&nbsp;
Osman, died under mysterious circumstances some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.780 --> 00:18:00.480
days after the women disappeared. Although the&nbsp;
death was initially ruled an accidental drowning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:07.260
further testimonies, including by Margarita in&nbsp;
the podcast, seem to agree that there was foul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:14.040
play involved. Details like the types of injuries&nbsp;
Osman had and the fact that some members of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:20.580
local gang disrupted the youth’s funeral seem to&nbsp;
support the idea that this was no simple drowning.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.160
While being interviewed by Mariana and&nbsp;
Jeremy, Margarita claims that her son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.280
was killed because he knew what had happened to&nbsp;
the “Holandesas”, Spanish for Dutch women. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.080
goes on to describe the specific scenario&nbsp;
she claims led to the death of the women,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.780
which was relayed to her by a former member of&nbsp;
the local gang involved. This former member,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:49.500
Jose Manuel, was also reported as having died&nbsp;
under mysterious circumstances, like Osman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.940
but a year after the events occurred.&nbsp;
Margarita claims he was killed because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.740
his fellow gang members thought he was close&nbsp;
to revealing the fate of the Dutch women.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:05.280
According to Margarita, a local gang known as the&nbsp;
“Bandida”, who had met and partied with the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:11.280
before and who were apparently friendly with her&nbsp;
son, intercepted the women while they were on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:17.220
trail and then took them partying. During the&nbsp;
party, one of the women rejected advances from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:23.700
one of the men, and then the whole group, drug&nbsp;
fueled and in a rage, abused and killed the women.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.800
According to Margarita, every finding&nbsp;
after the first picture from the first day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:35.100
was planned by the gang as a way to hide what&nbsp;
they did. It if were possible to verify this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.540
it could help track with the weird&nbsp;
phone usage patterns, the later photos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:45.960
and even the potential deleted photos. It could&nbsp;
also explain why the belonging and remains started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.380
appearing suddenly after several months, in weird&nbsp;
patterns and under suspicious circumstances.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.360
The testimony of Margarita is paired&nbsp;
in the podcast with the finding of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.580
independent detective Martin O’Donnell, who&nbsp;
has investigated the case of Lisanne and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.680
Kris thoroughly and reached a conclusion that&nbsp;
was similar to what was claimed by Margarita.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.160
The Panamanian authorities officially closed the&nbsp;
case years ago, deciding that the explanation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.980
of an accident causing the disappearance was&nbsp;
what made the most sense. Years of sleuthing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:26.940
by many independent parties had slowly uncovered&nbsp;
a lot of issues with the investigation, and even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:32.760
though nothing is certain, it seems likelier&nbsp;
with each new revelation that some foul play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.700
might have been involved. Since the disappearance&nbsp;
of Lisanne and Kris, several other people have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:45.060
disappeared at or near the trail, with some of&nbsp;
the disappearances being investigated as murders.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:50.340
If indeed a third party was involved in&nbsp;
the disappearance, it would be paramount&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.440
to bring them to justice so they can’t&nbsp;
do that to anyone else. But the truth of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:01.080
the matter is that we don’t really know what&nbsp;
happened. Their families have suffered through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:08.220
years of scrutiny and conflicting narratives,&nbsp;
through countless blog posts, forum threads and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:13.440
anonymous sources. Hopefully their quest&nbsp;
for closure will be eventually fulfilled.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:18.900
All we know is that Lisanne and Kris wanted&nbsp;
to walk among the clouds that day in April,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.300
and that the best way to honor them is to&nbsp;
remember them as they were, two aspiring,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:31.920
intelligent and vibrant young women whose lives&nbsp;
were tragically cut short. May they rest in peace.
