00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.500
Froon and Kremers: Exploring&nbsp;
the guide as a suspect&nbsp;

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.920
Panama's dense, lush forests have a reputation&nbsp;
for being a place of untamed beauty, but for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.340
two Dutch women, it became a nightmare. Kris&nbsp;
Kremers and Lisanne Froon set out on a hike,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.400
documenting their journey on&nbsp;
a camera and their phones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.060
but when they did not return, a search ensued.
What was discovered only deepened the mystery:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.060
scattered bones, personal items, and cryptic&nbsp;
clues that pointed to a sinister fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.820
Was it an accident, an abduction,&nbsp;
or something even more nefarious?&nbsp;

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.200
Theories abound, but no one knows precisely what&nbsp;
happened to these two young women. Join us as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.020
we delve into the enigmatic case of Kremers and&nbsp;
Froon, uncovering the secrets of their final days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.680
and a possible suspect with links to multiple&nbsp;
strange deaths in the dark side of paradise!&nbsp;

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.460
Let's have a quick look at the&nbsp;
timeline of this perplexing case.&nbsp;

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.440
Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon left their host&nbsp;
family's home in Boquete, Panama, on April 1st,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.980
2014, intending to walk the family's dog through&nbsp;
the scenic forests near the Baru volcano.&nbsp;

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.380
Both students, from Amersfoort, Netherlands,&nbsp;
meticulously planned their vacation to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.300
Panama for six months. Their itinerary&nbsp;
included leisurely hikes, sightseeing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.340
community service by teaching children arts&nbsp;
and crafts, and a course in the Spanish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.210
language.
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.920
The pair had hiked through the Panamanian&nbsp;
rainforest for two weeks as part of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.500
service-oriented backpacking journey. They&nbsp;
intended to spend the next four weeks working at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.440
a nearby school and living with their host family.
However, they vanished without a trace after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.080
saying goodbye to their host family at&nbsp;
11 a.m. on April 1st. Before their hike,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.220
the women announced their intention to&nbsp;
explore the neighboring village on Facebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
Moreover, they mentioned brunching&nbsp;
with two male Dutch acquaintances.&nbsp;

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.880
The host family realized something was amiss&nbsp;
when the dog returned alone that evening.&nbsp;

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.120
The following day, on April 2nd, the host family&nbsp;
contacted authorities when Kremers and Froon did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.660
not appear for a private hiking excursion with&nbsp;
a local guide Feliciano Gonzalez. The next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.480
the residents conducted an exhaustive search&nbsp;
on foot in the village and surrounding sparsely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.160
wooded regions and an aerial search of the jungle.
 As of April 6th, the women were still missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.080
The families of Kremers and Froon and&nbsp;
investigators from the Netherlands made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.800
their way to Panama out of fear&nbsp;
of the worst possible outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.180
Ten consecutive days were spent searching the&nbsp;
forests alongside local police and canine units.&nbsp;

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.040
Ten weeks passed before any&nbsp;
trace of the two women was found.&nbsp;

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.900
A breakthrough in the case occurred when&nbsp;
an indigenous tribes woman turned in a blue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.180
backpack to the police. She claimed that she found&nbsp;
the backpack near a riverbank. The bag contained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.380
two pairs of eyeglasses, $83 in cash, Froon's&nbsp;
passport, two undergarments, a water container,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.160
a camera, and both women's cellphones.
 &nbsp;

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.560
The phones remained active for nearly ten&nbsp;
days after their disappearance, with 77&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.000
call attempts to the emergency numbers, 112 in the&nbsp;
Netherlands and 911 in Panama, within four days.&nbsp;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.600
The first two calls to emergency number 112&nbsp;
were made within hours of starting their hike.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.640
Due to the density of the forest, neither&nbsp;
call went through to the emergency number.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.460
Only one of 77 attempts to contact&nbsp;
emergency services was successful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.240
but the connection was severed within two seconds.
The police discovered that on April 6th,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.240
numerous unsuccessful attempts were made to&nbsp;
access Kremers' phone with an incorrect PIN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.840
The right PIN was never inputted afterward.&nbsp;
As of April 11th, both phones were dead.&nbsp;

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.960
Even though the call history was unsettling, it&nbsp;
paled compared to what was captured on the camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.520
The camera's first images were&nbsp;
captured on the morning of April&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.820
1st when the women began their journey.
The subsequent photographs were alarming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.920
Images captured in the early morning hours&nbsp;
of April 8th showed the women's belongings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.680
strewn across rocks, plastic bags, and&nbsp;
empty confectionery packets. In addition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.040
there was a disturbing picture of the rear of&nbsp;
Kremers' head with blood oozing from her temple.&nbsp;

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.600
 Following an investigation of the area&nbsp;
where the backpack was found, authorities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.300
discovered Kremers' shorts neatly arranged on the&nbsp;
riverbank. Two months later, a boot with a foot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.120
and a pelvic bone was found in the same area.
Bones from the two women suddenly started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.940
appearing after the first discovery of their&nbsp;
remains. The bones of Lisanne Froon seemed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.740
to have endured natural decomposition,&nbsp;
with some flesh still adhering to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.980
In contrast, Kremers' bones appeared to have&nbsp;
been bleached, as they were starkly white.&nbsp;

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.980
 Despite interrogating nearby residents, tour&nbsp;
guides, and other hikers at the time, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.340
authorities could not uncover any added evidence&nbsp;
besides photographs and call logs that could cast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.940
light on the incident. Insufficient evidence&nbsp;
existed to determine the cause of mortality.&nbsp;

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.380
The Panamanian government had&nbsp;
ruled their deaths an accident!&nbsp;

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.700
But is there more to this case than meets the eye?&nbsp;

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.920
Journalist Mariana Atencio, who&nbsp;
took a deep dive into the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.800
of the missing Dutch women, and commented-
"This story is that explosive in Boquete.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.320
A dirty little secret everyone theorizes&nbsp;
about. They refer to it in hushed tones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.840
and many won't dare grant you an interview about&nbsp;
it in broad daylight. During our investigation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.200
we came across government corruption, possible&nbsp;
drug trafficking, even mentions of organ and human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.140
trafficking. Without giving too much away, I will&nbsp;
tell you that my life was directly threatened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.360
which had never happened before, even while&nbsp;
covering cartel-related violence in Mexico&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.440
or crackdowns against protests in China or&nbsp;
Cuba". She went on by saying, "As the team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.660
dug into what happened to Kris and Lisanne&nbsp;
eight years ago, we found more than 50 cases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:41.100
of missing women and girls in that same 40-mile&nbsp;
corridor of Panama. Femicide – extreme violence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.580
and murder of women based on their gender – is&nbsp;
so rampant in Latin America it has been labeled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:54.360
a "shadow pandemic" by the United Nations.”
If the women were murdered, who was responsible?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.060
Could it be a man who embedded himself into the&nbsp;
search, knows the area like the back of his hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.820
and has, through association, a string&nbsp;
of 'accidents' and murders linked to him?&nbsp;

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:12.720
One person's name keeps coming up when suspects&nbsp;
are mentioned, the tour guide Feliciano Gonzalez.&nbsp;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.600
Feliciano Gonzalez was among the last to&nbsp;
see the women alive before disappearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.720
After the girls went missing, he investigated the&nbsp;
girls' dorm room, notified the police and claimed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.000
to have seen vultures circling the area. In&nbsp;
addition, Gonzalez discovered some of the women's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.700
remains far to the north on the Serpent River.
None of this sounds too suspicious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:41.400
but upon deeper investigation into&nbsp;
Gonzalez, some things don't add up!&nbsp;

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.460
Nobody 'sleuths' like internet sleuths, and the&nbsp;
internet doesn't disappoint when it comes to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:52.440
suspicions around Gonzalez and his family!!!
One Redditor paints a picture of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.600
how involved Gonzalez was in the&nbsp;
case...maybe a little too involved!

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.660
"In my mind, Feliciano is very suspicious.
He has a poor reputation for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.040
being alone with women.
The girls have his card in their bedroom and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:14.040
have made an appointment with him for April 2nd.
Possibly they found out about his poor reputation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.080
and decided to go alone rather than with&nbsp;
him. Else why did they go a day early?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.960
Or else they never had an appointment with him.
When they don't show up, he goes to Myriam's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.060
house to look for them. She lets him have the key&nbsp;
to their room when he asks after he realizes they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.160
didn't come home the night before. (Myriam and&nbsp;
the Language School behavior point to the local&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:41.280
culture of not really getting upset about&nbsp;
canceled plans / people not showing up/an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:48.060
apathetic attitude to others. Why did he decide&nbsp;
to look for them? How did he know where to look?

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:54.300
He and another man are in their room&nbsp;
for 30 mins unaccompanied. Why do long?&nbsp;

00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:01.320
He 'goes to look' for them up the trail.
He phoned the police at 5 p.m., why so late??&nbsp;

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.240
He takes part in the search (inserts&nbsp;
himself into the investigation)&nbsp;

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.920
He finds Lisannes's foot or&nbsp;
is there when it is found.&nbsp;

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.897
Is all too much coincidence /&nbsp;
involvement for one person ???&nbsp;

00:09:15.897 --> 00:09:19.200
 
Gonzalez's bad reputation with 'European&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.420
women' stems from a Trip Advisor review that&nbsp;
warns single women about being alone with him.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.080
“It took me almost a year&nbsp;
to finally post this review.&nbsp;

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:35.340
I strongly recommend women to not hire Feliciano&nbsp;
as your guide if you're by yourself. It's a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.680
contrast if you look at the other reviews, where&nbsp;
Feliciano is described as a very nice person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.240
which he probably is for many people.&nbsp;
I have to say, he's very charming,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.060
funny and you can probably, as you will read in&nbsp;
the other reviews, have a great day with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:57.480
Did a walking tour with him. He's the guide that&nbsp;
knows the area by heart. Not long after we left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:04.140
he subtly started to flirt with me and also&nbsp;
touched me, first my hand, but also my arms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:10.440
shoulder, and legs, even after telling him&nbsp;
many times to stop doing that. He wears a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.840
big machete and suggested chopping off my legs&nbsp;
(this, of course, was a joke, but still...).&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.900
He has an obsession with Northern&nbsp;
European women, and I felt very unsafe.&nbsp;

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:28.740
It's a personal story, but google his name, and&nbsp;
you'll unfortunately find more stories like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.340
about him."
 &nbsp;

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.320
Gonzalez has also changed his story of the day the&nbsp;
women went missing, as seen in this Reddit post

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.020
So there are 2 versions of events&nbsp;
that Feliciano claimed occurred:&nbsp;

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.120
Early on in the investigation, he told the press&nbsp;
he had seen the girls at the Spanish school the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:55.200
day before (March 31st), said hello, and gave them&nbsp;
his card. He claims Kris was lying in the hammock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.920
Lisanne was browsing through some guide leaflets.
Months later, he recanted this story and said he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.020
never met the girls but had an appointment&nbsp;
with them the next day (April 2nd) to visit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:14.520
his ranch and Volcan Baru (along with Eileen).
In this photo, taken of the girl's room, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:20.700
can see his calling card on Kris's bed. Did the&nbsp;
girls place the card there, or did Feliciano plant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:26.880
it there when he accessed their room the next&nbsp;
morning after the disappearance...? All very odd.&nbsp;

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:33.360
So, is Gonzalez just a creep, or does he have&nbsp;
something to do with the girl's disappearance?&nbsp;

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.760
Three months after the women went missing,&nbsp;
Lisanne's blue backpack is discovered on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.000
edge of a river bank near the unmapped village of&nbsp;
Alto Romero, approximately 5 miles from where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.400
girls were believed to have been hiking. In&nbsp;
the jungle, five miles is a great distance!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.380
Alto Romero doesn't even exist on maps!

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.420
When the blue backpack was discovered, its&nbsp;
contents were arranged and in perfect order.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:06.480
The woman who found the blue backpack asserts that&nbsp;
it was not there previously and looked like it had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.600
been cleaned. This indicates that the backpack&nbsp;
was placed there shortly before being discovered.&nbsp;

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.640
Gonzalez coincidentally&nbsp;
owns a farm in Alto Romero.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:25.200
Gonzalez's sons and their apparent gang-linked&nbsp;
friends have also been implicated. This Reddit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.480
post is among many who think the two women's&nbsp;
disappearance was a Gonzalez family affair.&nbsp;

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:38.100
"Feliciano was involved with absolutely everything&nbsp;
to do with this case. From finding bones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.500
to reportedly cleaning the backpack before&nbsp;
turning it into police. Its a classic case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:49.560
of the murderer joining in on the search and even&nbsp;
finding clues so there is no suspicion on him. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.600
feel the sons are involved too, keeping it in&nbsp;
the family is how they got away with this, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.700
most likely have gotten away with it in the past,&nbsp;
and will continue to kill again in the future."&nbsp;

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:06.720
Henry Eliezer Gonzalez, the eldest son of&nbsp;
Feliciano Gonzalez, is possibly affiliated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.420
with a local youth gang in the area. The two&nbsp;
women had previously visited Bocas del Toro&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:17.580
before their journey to Boquete; Henry&nbsp;
Gonzalez is a frequent visitor to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:22.980
Bocas del Toro area. While intoxicated,&nbsp;
he was overheard saying strange things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:28.140
about his encounter with the two women the&nbsp;
day they went missing. As with his father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:33.960
he is rumored to have an interest in foreign&nbsp;
women and to be a smooth-talker. Although no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:40.020
direct evidence implicates him, many online users&nbsp;
have speculated about his possible involvement.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.120
More disturbing is the number of deaths that&nbsp;
have happened to those with ties to the case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:51.420
and the Gonzalez family!
Osman Valenzuela&nbsp;

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:56.280
Valenzuela vanished three days after&nbsp;
the disappearance of the women. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:02.700
Osman was discovered drowned in the Chiriquisito&nbsp;
River. Valenzuela was possibly affiliated with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:08.820
juvenile gang. It was later determined that&nbsp;
he had met Kris and Lisanne. His body was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:16.320
discovered just 25 meters from where he was last&nbsp;
seen between the municipalities of Boquete and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:23.280
Gualaca. According to rumors, no water was found&nbsp;
in his lungs, and his corpse was discovered in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.920
unnatural position that would not have helped&nbsp;
drowning. To add to the confusion, Betzaida&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:36.540
Pitt verified in 2021 that Osman had helped&nbsp;
SINAPROC with the searches for Kris and Lisanne.&nbsp;

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.740
Jose Manuel Murgas
Murgas worked with Osman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:47.940
and was killed in a hit-and-run accident in 2015.&nbsp;
Murgas was possibly a member of a juvenile gang.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:54.240
Henry Eliezer Gonzalez wrote on Facebook&nbsp;
that Jose was his "Little soul brother"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.000
after his passing. His corpse was discovered on&nbsp;
the side of the road between Boquete and Dolega,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.120
close to the entrance to the Caldera neighborhood&nbsp;
in the Boquete neighborhood of Chiriqu.&nbsp;

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.820
Jorge Rivera Miranda
Miranda was Henry Eliezer Gonzalez's friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:19.020
and may have had gang ties. On April 4th, 2015, he&nbsp;
was discovered drowned in extremely shallow water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:26.040
His corpse was found in the Grande Stream of the&nbsp;
Dos Ros community in Chiriqu's Dolega district.&nbsp;

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.760
 
 &nbsp;

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.360
 
Leonardo Arturo González Mastinu&nbsp;

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.160
Mastinu was the taxi driver who initially&nbsp;
transported the women to the trailhead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.980
before their hike. He was discovered to be&nbsp;
drowned in the Est River on March 3rd, 2015,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.040
just before the case closed.
 &nbsp;

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.500
One person close to the Gonzalez's who didn't die,&nbsp;
maybe because she had the right mind to get as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:55.320
far away as possible from them after Kremer's&nbsp;
and Froon's disappearance, was Eileen Witek.&nbsp;

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:02.220
Witek was a German citizen living in Boquete.&nbsp;
She was an "assistant hotel manager" who worked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.680
for Feliciano Gonzalez. After they neglected to&nbsp;
show up for their scheduled hike with Feliciano&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.980
on April 2nd, she accompanied him to the women's&nbsp;
hostel, where they were lodging. Eileen helped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:20.400
Feliciano in reporting the disappearance to&nbsp;
the police. She left Boquete and returned to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:27.180
Germany within days after that. It is unknown&nbsp;
how much she knows, but her sudden departure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.860
from Boquete is rather suspicious.
The case would have been looked at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:37.680
very differently by authorities if all of these&nbsp;
characters and events had been followed up on.&nbsp;

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:44.640
What most likely happened to the women if we take&nbsp;
a hypothetical view and add the mentioned people?

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.900
The women started on their hike, and at some&nbsp;
point, they are accosted by Gonzalez Sr, Jnr,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:58.560
or both. They flee down the trail while dialing&nbsp;
emergency numbers and are cornered or trapped but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:05.340
the person or persons pursuing them. Some type of&nbsp;
sexually motivated crime occurs, and the girls are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:11.160
murdered. The dismemberment and holding on to the&nbsp;
bodies for decomposition to take place destroys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.740
any evidence. Days later, the perpetrator&nbsp;
unsuccessfully tries to open their phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:23.580
and takes several photos, with the camera, deep&nbsp;
in the jungle at night to confuse investigators.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:31.260
The perpetrator then plants the skeletal remains,&nbsp;
backpack, and neatly folded clothing items in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:37.860
area that would be easily found, ruling&nbsp;
out a kidnapping or crime. Any witnesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:43.080
close to the Gonzalez are murdered to make&nbsp;
sure that their involvement is never leaked.&nbsp;

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:48.060
We need to consider that the authority's&nbsp;
case was flawed, and there may have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:53.220
political pressure to close it as soon as&nbsp;
possible to not shed a bad light on one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.220 --> 00:18:01.500
Panama’s most lucrative industries... tourism!
The Attorney General of Panama, Betzaida Pitti,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.760
asserted that the woman died in a&nbsp;
hiking accident when other evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:11.700
showing otherwise could not be uncovered. The&nbsp;
case was closed shortly after that. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.980
not all of the evidence was examined.&nbsp;
No suspects were ever interviewed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.780
and some investigators knew that&nbsp;
the official story was unacceptable.&nbsp;

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:28.740
"The official version of the story makes no&nbsp;
sense," said Enrique Arrocha, who represented the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:34.680
Kremers family in court. Arrocha's communication&nbsp;
was also odd during a meeting to discuss the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:41.220
His voice and body language suggested he was&nbsp;
being threatened, but he never specified by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:47.340
whom. He was also escorted by a bodyguard.
 "It's almost impossible for the bones to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:53.100
be in this condition," said Arrocha. He&nbsp;
noted that the chief forensic examiner had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:58.380
publicly speculated that lime may have&nbsp;
been used to accelerate decomposition.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:06.960
Nobody knows what happened to Kris Kremers and&nbsp;
Lisanne Froon. Because the investigation concluded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:13.140
prematurely and the authorities mishandled&nbsp;
the entire process, many gaps in the case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:19.140
may never be filled. Most importantly, the man&nbsp;
who saw them last, knew where they were going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:26.520
and is linked to multiple 'tying up loose ends'&nbsp;
murders was never questioned or even suspected!&nbsp;

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.680
Do you, The Bad Things Crew, think&nbsp;
the Gonzalez's were involved?&nbsp;
