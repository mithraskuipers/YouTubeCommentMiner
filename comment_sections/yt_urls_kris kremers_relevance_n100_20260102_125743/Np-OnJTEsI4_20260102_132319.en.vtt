00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.280
In 2014, two Dutch tourists, Kris and Lisanne,&nbsp;
vanished in Panama… What happened to them remains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.640
a mystery. On April 1st, they set out for a hike&nbsp;
with a local man’s dog —the dog returned but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.160
never did. So a search began to look for them.&nbsp;
Days later some locals found their backpack,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.920
Inside was their phones, a camera and money but&nbsp;
no sign of them. After that... things got even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.120
stranger. Inside were 90+ bizarre photos,&nbsp;
some taken at night. Flash shots of rocks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.160
trees and even the back of Kris's head.&nbsp;
Their phones showed they tried calling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.360
911 but had no signal and Lisanne's phone was&nbsp;
used days later after the 911 calls - someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.400
entered the wrong PIN multiple times. Weeks&nbsp;
later their bones are found scattered miles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.080
apart but how they died is still debated. Was&nbsp;
it an accident... or something more Sinister?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.200
Someone tried using the phone after she&nbsp;
died but was it Kris or someone else.
