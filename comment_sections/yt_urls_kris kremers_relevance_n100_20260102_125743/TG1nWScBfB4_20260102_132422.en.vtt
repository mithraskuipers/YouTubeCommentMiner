00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.510
[glitchy noise]

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.649
Vacations to another country can be some of the best times of your life.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.820
getting away...

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.460
experiencing a culture nothing like your own

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.739
and traversing through some of the most memorable places on earth are truly something to hold with you for a lifetime.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.110
Oftentimes, on said trips...

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.659
Warnings are made to stay within the boundaries of where you're supposed to be, whether it be a hotel, a

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.100
host family's house, or even a resort.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.920
It's generally pretty strongly urged to, without a guide, stay on the path set forth in front of you

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.240
unfortunately, many of us have that growing instinctive curiosity

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.900
What if we ventured out on our own? Ignored the warnings and truly explored where we were?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.560
How badass would that be?

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.559
Nothing that bad could ever happen to us, right?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.290
Except..

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.620
It can, and when it comes to the tragic case surrounding two girls from the Netherlands on their trip to Panama

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.280
it did...

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.820
Today we're going to explore the evidence and story surrounding the harrowing disappearance of Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.080
Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon are two girls from the Netherlands

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.140
Who made their way to Panama to celebrate Kris graduating from school. They arrived to the country on March 15, 2014

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.740
and explored around for two weeks before reaching their destination, the city of Boquete on March 29th

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.279
The girls allegedly had plans to volunteer to work with the local school and to improve upon their own Spanish

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.160
Kris carried around a diary, and allegedly she noted that the aforementioned school let them know

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.699
That they arrived an entire week early, and were pretty rude about it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.199
Anyway, on April 1st, 2014 at around 10 a.m.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.630
The girls embarked with the host families dog on a hike up the la pianista trail, near the continental divide

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.609
Everything seemed to go pretty, well and the host family had believed everything

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.190
Was fine up until a few hours later when the family's dog returned home without the girls

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.100
The host family, was immediately worried and called the police

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.320
unfortunately the national system of civil protection or

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.169
SINAPROC as they call it in the region took the case very lightly, and didn't take action for four whole days

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.239
During this time span

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.869
Local residents and tour guides were assisting the family and searching for the missing girls themselves since police lacked

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.870
Any sort of desire for immediate action

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.069
Once the search finally, did start officials were met with a huge roadblock

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.620
The girls didn't exactly, tell anybody, where they were going when they left so search teams had little to go off of

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.260
The search then commenced to no avail

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.680
Hours turned into, days

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.760
Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months until june 9th of that same year when an Agoby

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.190
Woman found a backpack, and turned it into police

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.149
She had claimed that she found it on the riverbank of the serpent river

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.839
Strangely it was dry and packed well.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.360
Inside were two bras two pairs of sunglasses a small water bottle

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.399
Lisanne's camera, two smart phones, a passport and 83 dollars

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.259
The police decided to investigate the call records and photos that were on the phones and camera

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.110
And what they found allowed them to start piecing together the puzzle

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.350
Allegedly, the girls have taken over 100 pictures on their venture the strange part is only about ten of them were taken during the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.560
day time.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.280
Remaining 90 plus were all at the late late

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:01.119
Hours between 1:00 to 4:00 in the morning and 87 of those remaining 90 show nothing but blackness a

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.280
Lot of mystery surrounds the final image of the girls took, which, was purportedly taken 8, days after the start of the hike

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.479
It shows, some sort of rock formation or a trail however the orientation of the camera is debatable

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.229
Some people claim it it's a shot looking forward down a trail, while others have stated that it could be pointing up a cliff

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.829
One huge mystery that i can't quite wrap, my head around

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.380
surrounds the timing of this photo

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.329
Let's think about it, the girls started their journey at around 10 a.m. on April 1st.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.939
This photo, was taken on april 8th

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.979
Presumably, by this point in time the girls to our knowledge had minimal amounts of water on them due to the contents that were found

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:45.949
in the backpack

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.739
How, would either of them be alive at this point to take, this photo the human

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.109
Body can go anywhere from seven and ten, days without water, with ten days being on the less common end of the spectrum

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.130
These girls have been out in the jungle all of this time presumably exhausting themselves, while trying to find their, way, back home

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.520
How did they make it this long?

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.100
It's just a question that hasn't ever escaped

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.699
My mind since the first time i took a look at this photo and learned of the timestamp

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.610
anyway i digress

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.379
The reason for the photo is largely unknown, but, say one of the girls

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.919
Did take it along with all 87 of the other pitch-black photos.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.859
A theory, is that they could have been lighting up the path in front of them in order to save their phone batteries so they could

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.860
Use that to check for a signal

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.809
That actually ties into, my next segment of the story

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.810
The Phones

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.139
Police were able to extract the call records from their devices and they found that the girls made their initial attempt to call one one?

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:51.069
Two the dutch emergency, line and 9-1-1 the panamanian emergency, line just hours after starting their hike

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.039
This, tells us that on day one

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.889
Something went wrong here

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.089
Throughout the course of time from april 1st. Through april 6th the girls

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.970
Would make intermittent attempts at early morning or late night hours

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.679
To, power on their phones to check for a signal before powering them off again shortly after

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.220
One strange thing to note here, is that after april

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.109
6th multiple incorrect pen attempts were entered into the iphone and police had determined that a

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.229
Successful pin was never entered, again, from this point forward that

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:22.090
Fact right there

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.149
Is strange to me and i have two theories to discuss here backing up to the photos i wanted to make one quick point

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.250
Police had found that the filenames of the images were numbered starting at 499. For instance their first image was 499

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.489
The second image, was 500 so on and so forth

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.309
One strange part about this, is that they could never find image 509

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:51.369
We have over 100 images that were left on the camera and the only image that is missing is?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.049
Conveniently the one between the final daytime image and the first nighttime image

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.739
Why, through all of this, would

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.079
The girls be concerned with deleting any image from their phone especially while in a situation, like this

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.759
That would be the absolute last, thing i'd ever be thinking of doing

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.319
Investigators were never able to recover the photo, and they had determined that it wasn't deleted through the camera itself

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.549
Jumping, back to the pin numbers again, what if there was a third party involved? There very

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.710
Well could have been someone else in these woods following the girls and trying to potentially murder them

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.710
Say, this third party, was successful they could be potentially trying to wipe information, which

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.639
strangely could be related to the missing photo 509

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:46.389
Now, before you grill me on this theory hang tight because i have something to back this up shortly

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:54.909
Anyway, the other theory that i have surrounding this is the idea that chris was either unconscious or dead due to injury or other natural

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:57.218
Causes, and left her iphone with lizanne

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:04.180
Lizanne, likely didn't know the password to it and made multiple guess attempts at getting into it potentially to try to make more phone calls

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.180
Or use the flashlight

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:10.899
Since she realized that it was hopeless she power to back off and never turned it on again

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.640
Back to the investigation

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.579
Locals had found lizanne shorts upstream from, where the backpack

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.830
Was found and this is where the inconsistencies and glaring holes of police mismanagement come into play

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.720
The "official story"

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.140
Is that the shorts were found neatly folded on a rock. However

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.760
According to the guide that found them they were in an eddy on a river near monkey bridge

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.810
Accompanying these shorts the locals claimed that they found chris's boot

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.920
With her footstool in it and a fragment of lizenz pelvis which appeared to be sun-bleached

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:49.290
They, also found multiple bone fragments that belong to the two girls however there were three fragments out of all of these that were undetermined

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.269
With the photos in hand the shorts found and the bones

00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:01.019
Identified the police had determined that kris had fallen off a nearby monkey bridge and either went unconscious or dead and lizanne

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.830
Had left to go to find help

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.359
Since her backpack containing nothing of true use, she ditched it nearby

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.040
And with that her shorts since they could have been chafing her. On the way

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.229
Back she used the camera to take photos of the blackness to light up the trail in front of her and during that trek back

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.989
Exhausted or injured herself and passed away.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.440
Solved. Right?

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.959
Well this story is highly contested due to extreme police mismanagement

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:36.020
Allegedly, other fingerprints were found on the backpack however the findings proved to be useless since they weren't tracking prints through the investigation

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.520
Also as we said before, SINAPROC took four entire days to begin the search mission

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.660
and as we know the first 24 hours are the most vital part of any

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.420
search-and-rescue

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.430
There's, also one other thing

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.939
Remember that theory that i had earlier about a third party being involved

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.090
Let's gather our evidence that supports that really fast

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:04.829
First, we have a missing image 509, which conveniently bridges the gap between the last, day time, and first night time image

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.760
we have a

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.369
Backpack, that was found on a riverbank that, was completely dry, and well packed, we also have some bone fragments that are

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.479
belonging to a third party there are unidentified fingerprints on the backpack and

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:22.439
Lastly, both bodies completely decomposed and were broken apart, after just nine weeks between april and june

00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:25.439
hmmm...

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:27.439
Something seems strange here.

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:32.539
I say, this because just last, year a girl, named katherine johanna

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:38.719
Was visiting the same region of panama and was brutally strangled to death by her own shirt while she was hiking in the region

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:42.109
Tuh date only one teen suspect

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:48.439
Has been identified in the case, what if this same person has something to do with the strange disappearances of Kris and Lisanne?

00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:56.719
It really is strange to me and something about this case particularly with, the final night image doesn't add up to me

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:06.589
The tragic death of Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon is truly a mystery and i hope that, some day, some actual answers can

00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:07.949
Be found with this case

00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:12.139
while there's much speculation, surrounding the possibility of a third party being involved

00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:17.449
This very well could be a simple case of going hiking unprepared, getting lost,

00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:21.709
And dying due to lack of food or water combined with a possible injury.

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:29.688
While we may never truly know where these girls went, or what transpired on those presumably endless ten days of agony, we can

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.479
Always, speculate with the evidence that, we do currently have

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:43.429
We just explored the harrowing, mystery surrounding the disappearance of Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon, this is a case that's baffled

00:11:43.429 --> 00:11:43.939
Me for quite

00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:46.849
Some time and a hull of this interested you as much as it did me

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:51.949
If you have any theories or any evidence that i may have missed feel free to send them

00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:53.949
my way. I'd love to check it out

00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:59.208
Lastly thanks so much for watching. I love you all and good night.
