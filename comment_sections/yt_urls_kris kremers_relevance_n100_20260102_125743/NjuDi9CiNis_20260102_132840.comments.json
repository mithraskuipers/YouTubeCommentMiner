    "text": "This girls come from my hometown Amersfoort. Today I saw a tv episode about Lisanne Vroon. What really moved me was that her parents an brother said that they are still glad that Lisanne went to Panama, that she did what she wanted to do. \nIn the documentary her brother and a the guide, who alarmed the authorities, followed the same path as the girls did. Everywhere aside the path are warning signs that it can be very slippery. These signs were placed after the accident. So I think they didn’t wander of the trail but slides from the path, where one of the girls broke her foot.\nThere is one mystery however. The original trail is to the top. Then you go back. The girls didn’t go back, they went on. But somehow I can understand that. Lisanne played volleyball on a heigh level, so her condition was ok. Then it’s easy to think “let’s go a little further”. \nAll in all she had well spent time in Panama. So I understand the feelings of the family. They want to celebrate her life, not her death.",

    "text": "Other youtube videos talk about a deleted photo from the camera that can't be retrieved. Photo number 509 that was between the last daytime photos and the night photos taken days later. It couldn't be retrieved because it looked like someone downloaded that photo from the camera to another computer. Also looking at the daytime photos you see a change in the mood and terrain. At first the photos show both girls on the high ground and looking happy. Then it changes to showing them on low ground going deeper into the jungle and only one of the girls is in the pictures and she doesn't look happy.\n\nThe first cellphone call was made only a couple of hours after the last day photo 508 was taken. They ran into a third party out there and may have got a picture of them (missing 509) and managed to get away. Unfortunately they were totally lost and grouped out the jungle for next next few days being chased and were caught again and killed. \n\nThose 77 attempts to get into the iphone were made by the third party, probably looking to see if it had any photos in it. I believe the night photos were taken to make it look like the girls got lost and one of them was hurt in a fall. The girls were long dead by then. The backpack was found in an area that was 12 hours away from where the girls were hiking. The backpack and its contends were dry and the camera and phones were in working order. Someone held on to them and then placed them in a spot to be found two months later because there is no way they would be in good condition after sitting in a jungle during the rainy season all this time. Plus the backpack  and the girls remains were found upstream.\n\nThey were murdered and the incompetent and crooked government declared that they got lost and died by accident so the tourist would keep on coming.",

    "text": "I think you’re on the right track, Mike.\n\nA couple of thoughts:\n1. They might have been using the flash during the night as a last ditch effort hoping searchers or anyone might see it. The Panamanian jungle is simply pitch-black at night, so any light would would be anomalous & pique curiosity.\n\n2. It does look like they fashioned some crude flags to - again - try to signal for help.\n\n3. As for leaving the trail? I don’t find that mysterious at all! Young women, excited to be in such an exotic place, intelligent & educated, staying with locals who had surely imparted some knowledge of the area - it probably just didn’t seem like a big deal to explore a bit. They wouldn’t be the first tourists to underestimate how far off they wandered, either, & not be able to find their way back.\n\n4. Perhaps the friend of the wounded girl refused to leave her alone to seek help. They were already very lost at that point, no doubt scared out of their minds. Perhaps the wound was quite severe. Bleeding in the jungles of mid-to-S. America would immediately attract all kinds of bugs, creepy-crawlies, and, um . . . other creatures. Also, infection would/could set in immediately in such an environment.\n\n5. Doubtful they had much food or water with them. It would have been highly risky to partake of any local flora or water, too. If they had eaten anything in the environment, it could have led to serious illness, perhaps even hallucinations. Starving people will, however, eat anything. Not to discount whatever microbes would be in the stream water, either.\n\n6. In my opinion, one or both died of injuries combined with dehydration & exposure. What a terrible way to die! My heart breaks for their families/friends. We might be living in a modern age of amazing technology, science, & medicine - but none of that makes us immune to little errors that can quickly snowball into tragedy. We’re still just walking, talking bags of bone & protoplasm at the end of the day.\n\nI’m really impressed by your reporting, Mike (& I’m not easily impressed!) You look into stories on a deeper level & have more respect for facts than most on YouTube with similar channels. I’m also pleased that you’re okay with leaving things as they are - meaning unsolved, incomplete. That’s how reality works much of the time, unfortunately. So THANK YOU for for this most excellent channel! I enjoy it very much. Now I just have to remember to ‘thumbs up’ every video I watch!",

Sadly he died in a auto wreck but what's insane is he had a brother who became a serial killer too. You could do stories about him or his killer brother or both in the same video !

    "text": "Once seeing this case here on Mike's channel, i became obsessed with this case devouring tens of not, close to 100 hours of research and imho, i think that the mystery regarding the backpack and the actual cause for the girls demise are two entirely separate incidences and are really connected nor related. \nI think it was either dropped accidentally or intentionally by the last girl to die. If it was the former, it was either running away from some preceived immediate danger such as a 4 legged predator (even worse, a 2 legged predator) with nefarious intentions towards her survival. The second possible reason  is that she dropped accidentally and no way to safely retrieve it. \nNow if she intentionally  abandoned it, she was trying to leave clues for the parties that would inevitably come searching for them although common sense would dictate that you leave one clue at a time instead of the whole kitnkaboodle making the backpack et al. The ominous reason for that would be that she was either in the midst of foul play or had reason enough to be anticipating its immenant arrival OR what seemsplausible to me, she had deteriorated to the point that she no longer had the strenght to carry it.\nWhat i think occurred next is that a local came across the backpack and took it cos let's face it, who wouldn't take a brand new backpack they found in the middle of a jungle filled with things that someone above mentioned was worth more than what most of them earn in a year, even if it was only to try and find the original owners and return it. Upon realizing what was going on and who this backpack belonged to or the implications that it represented which made it impossible to profit from the items since it would make them suspect #1, they stayed low and then placed it where they knew it would be found with ease hence it's perfect condition. No body wants the authorities in their business which isbecome POI #1 which is objectionable for obvious reasons and it could also impact their operations if  they were involved with some sort of illegal activities in that area.\nNow, exactly what killed these two young girls? Obviously i don't know but I'd be putting my 💰 on them succumbing to their environment after a series of mishaps but readily agree that the chances for that not being the case is very much present for there are a few things that bother me about this case.",

I started at about 930/ 10pm and sunrise was around 6 am if I recall correctly. \n\nOne thing that struck me while doing that hike was towards the end of the hike - near the summit - there is a scrambling section with some really steep drops on either side - some sections the ground is quite unstable as it is all loose dirt and loose stone. I remember thinking if I fell or slipped on this section I was for sure a goner.\n\nIt was a bit freaky on that trail at night alone.",

    "text": "They were murdered. Nothing fits in this case. They never went far upstream, because the nightphoto with the 2 red plastic bags was made on the river with the bridge near the mirador. That means that the bones, the jeans and the bag must have floated UPSTREAM which is impossible. Then the bag was found 2 weeks later on a sandbank near the river. It must have floated upstream again and while being in the water, the camera and the mobile phone would have been destroyed. Furthermore the sunglasses are different from the ones the girls had. The girls were quite risk averse, because they started the same hike one day ago and stopped it due to nightfall - they knew where they were going.\nThen within 2 months the bodies do not disintegrate that much. Without external force this is totally impossible, even in the jungle. One bone of kris was bleached and saturated with phosphor. The last photo before the nightphotos began, was deleted by computer and therefore not restorable. There were fingerprints found on the camera, but never evaluated !! Then they were girls with smartphones. No fotos, no messages, nothing for days they shall have been alife ?\n\nThis whole story is so full of things that don´t fit together that i think they were kidnapped and killed. They were killed and all the \"proofs\" were made later to distract and let it look as if they just lost their way and got eaten by animals. What is even more frightening for me is that obviously the government of Panama seems to know more and hides it. Especially since the murder of Catherine Johannet in 2017 and the following investigation by FBI this became very clear.\n\nI can just advice people not to go to latin and south america. Those countries are very dangerous and one human life doesn´t count anything there. Search on the internet and you will find out that robberies and even murders of tourists take place everywhere there from Guatemala down to Argentina.",

There is a big inconsistently in the middle of this one that doesn't add up.\nForests of any kind, but most of all, jungles, are not kind to clothing...  So, over a few days, let alone the few weeks (was it?) It took for the shorts to be found they certainly shouldn't have appeared, \"folded neatly on the opposite side of the trail from where the backpack was found...\"  \nThis same backpack, containing the cellphones, that the lady swore, \"wasn't there the day before\", with no water or environmental damage?\n(Mike, are those the actual photos of what was recovered?  The items are way too clean in more than one way.)\nThe cellphones, pack and bones all should have been found together.  The shorts should have been on or near the pelvic bone or in the backpack, (if, for some reason, she had taken them off).  Not several metres away and folded up neatly.  \n\nMy theory is that it is most likely a case where a local found the stuff and, not realizing the importance of it, kept it, washed it, but, when the news about  investigation into the disappearances came into the area, they realized what they had and figured they'd better return the gear.\n\n Or... the Panamanian government is covering up for a serial killer in their mountains rather than lose the tourist dollars.  \nOr, the girls were trafficked.\n\nI have been watching too many of these videos to be thinking those last two...\nKeep safe.",

I think she took the photo of her own wound to see what the injury was like.... maybe they were trying to find a way off those rocks and so taking photos with the flash to see if you could walk off the rock safely or not and misjudged? Injuring themselves further, prompting the flurry of 911 calls???? But the tries at the PIN make me think someone either involved, or someone who found the thing, tried to get into it, when they couldn't, it was dumped.... this is a weirrrd one.  Looking forward to updates on it!!",

I had started just before dawn, but didn’t realize how dark it’d be nestled in the Andes. I was using flash photography on my camera and phone to navigate, then I ran into a friendly Aussie guy with a torch-beanie-thing he fashioned, whom I joined until we reached the gate. I related to their random night photos immediately as I remembered all the deleting I had to do afterwards (about 100 or so random night shots in dense woods).\n\nI think these gals were the victims of foul play, but then escaped temporarily in the darkness, navigating with their camera-flashes and calling for help with what little battery they had left. I fear that they were probably apprehended thereafter a final time.",

It's either a fall, a wild animal, getting lost, or a killer. When there are dozens of scenarios you can think up where it is multiple if not all of the above. Example; they wandered further in/off the path trying to flee someone following them. They ran into a wild animal and got lost trying to get away. One of them fell. The other ended up being found by the initial stalker. Any of those factors could have come in at any given time. A person could have even shown up after they were already dead. There are some sick people in this world. It doesn't have to be just one answer, unfortunately.",

The girls weren't kitted out for an overnight camp as they didn't expect to be doing so. Therefore, apart from the likelihood that whatever happened took place not long after Image 508 was taken, why did it take until late afternoon the next day for the flurry of telephone activity to commence? Perhaps they were unconscious, perhaps they were still mobile at that time and were concentrating on getting out of their predicament. In which case, the telephone activity didn't commence until they were unable to move any further.  Which makes their plight - which likely lasted for a whole week - all the more awful to contemplate.",

Two, one of the pictures taken by the women was deleted- as in, permanently- which could only have been done by connecting the phone to a computer and deleting the file.

I d-o think they innocently took a pic of something incriminating  (or just looked like easy prey) and the 3rd party followed/chased them (that's why the many 911 calls during the daytime after just about 2 hours on the trail, and the increasing uneasy look of the girl in the pics toward the end of the daytime pic series), caught them, scared off the dog and did what they wanted with them (that's why they couldn't have just followed the dog home) until they killed them (sorry), removed the photo from the phone when they looked thru the girls' stuff.  I believe the 3rd party took the nighttime pics to make it look like they were still alive and were just lost and died accidentally.  The rapid flashes were taken between 1 am and 4 am on the night that the police were combing thru the jungle looking for the girls...maybe the 3rd party offered to help \"look\" for the girls and had their phones.  The reason I say the last part, that the girls were not alive a week later, at night, when the night time pics were taken is because there would have been more night time pics or movies of them alive.  There's only one pic of the back of Kris's head (when she could have been dead)...the girls would have taken more pics of them alive in the dark or made a movie saying what happened...instead of just the back of one's head and some setup shots of rocks, homemade arrows meaning nothing etc. that I believe the 3rd party killers took.  That backpack and neatly folded shorts would not have survived in pristine condition the rainy season 2 months later, when they were placed there to be found by a local...who said they weren't there the day before.  Yep...poor girls.",

Those two things I find strange and the fact they went off the trail. Maybe something spooked them? They ran getting away from someone/something causing them to run off the trail and maybe that's how one of them fell causing the injury? 🤔🤔 I guess all we actually can do is speculate. At least they were together. 😔😔\nI don't think they made it the whole ten days. Especially with one having an injury to the head. They obviously both stayed together and I doubt they'd of lasted longer than a few days without water and generally fighting the elements. Night time being the worst.\nThese two being clever to take photos and leave markers where they had been or where to find them.\nAt least the bodies were found for the sake of the families.\nHow bloody terrible.. \nSuch a sad case and now story. 😔",

Because the cats require large swaths of unspoiled territory and access to the over 85 types of prey they hunt to survive, they are all endangered. Panama, which is dominated by two large national parks, is one of the few places these species still coexist in the wild. thanks again, and Hare` Krishna!",

I am VERY impressed that their home country sent police and search dogs to help find them. One wonders why cadaver dogs were not used by Panamanians before the rainy season, or whatever.",

    "text": "The local family looking after the girls should have prevented them from going. You need a leader type when doing exotic hiking and must stick to the rules. It would be interesting to know how long they intended to walk for. Surely a few hours at most. So at what point did the family expect them back. Example. Ok you start out at what time. Ok, start early and get back at midday. But it seems no real planning occurred.  Bad idea to start walking into the jungle at midday. So the whole Charade is what it is, a charade. Why walk off the path, this makes no sense. You would think that you would only trek as far as you know, to know how to back track easily. Why lose track of time, why allow yourself to get caught at night, in the middle of a jungle. It seems they got lost, which is a 100% guarantee, when you go off track. Then, one fell of that high ravine, caused no doubt by panic, attempting to continue walking, in spite of zero visibility. Sad story. \n Lastly, did they not know that they wouldn’t be able to contact anyone. I have a feeling that they actually believed they could. You would think, that theses kind of things would enter the mind of even those with a low IQ. You would also think, just for a moment, that if they met any bad people, then it’s kind of game over. Again, they seemed to have this naive, we are indestructible attitude. No form of communication, terrible planning and no experience. I feel sorry for them and it’s right to say, they received no advice.",

If they got lost then injured and then shortly after died their belongings would be still nearby them.\nYes animals MAY have separated the body parts over time but a monkey didn't come along and carry off this backpack then place it nicely in a open rice field to be found 2 months later.\nSo it's safe to say at some point some other person came across them or was involved in their demise.\nMy belief is someone lead them astray most likely tried to attack them, killed them and cut them up w/ their machetes thinking they (their parts) would never be seen again deep in the jungles of Panama.\nThese girls didn't even know Spanish so already there was a communication barrier. I don't believe they would've just wandered off the path of their own free will, just my opinion ofcourse.\nMy prayers and condolences go out to the families. Truly sad!!!",

They wouldn’t just lose their host’s dog and carry merrily on their way.\nI think they would have turned back and followed to check on the dog. I know I would. \nSo, did they leave the trail in an attempt to find or follow the dog? Or did someone or something prevent them from going after the dog? Forcing them on through the jungle?\nWas the dog, by running home, running for help?",

    "text": "Thanks for this video- is important to keep this tragedy visible. I've watched/read much about their disappearance. There's definitely some unanswered questions, of course (normal for cases where there's no surviving person). There have been some top experts who have reviewed  all available information and none believe there is enough  evidence to suggest foul play. My limited knowledge suggests the simplest explanation: they reached the summit (continental divide) and for reasons we'll never know, decided to explore the trail further, heading down the other side. This area is dense jungle with seldom-used trails making it easy to become disoriented. Most experienced hikers would likely begin backtracking and try to reach an elevated location to hopefully get cell service, but for unknown reasons these ladies continued down towards the opposite side of the divide. Experts will tell you that when a person becomes lost, they become susceptible to a variety of disorienting psychological challenges. It appears (based on forensics of the boot/foot found) that one of them suffered a broken foot, possibly while trying to cross one of the streams via cable bridge. Assuming they stayed together (very likely), this slowed their progress dramatically. The actual scenario towards the end will never be known, but they likely died from starvation (a person with a lean body can starve to death within 3-4 weeks, especially if exerting energy) and/or injuries/infections. Here's my take-away: I've read so many reports similar to this one; a couple things must be said. If you are a hiker going on unfamiliar (to you) terrain, seriously consider always arranging for a guide and/or very good compass, maps, GPS, etc., especially if you are a female. Sexist or not, males generally can survive better under extreme conditions and can also aid others who are mentally/physically disabled so take a trusted guy with you if possible.  My deepest condolences to the families. These two young ladies were clearly very special.",

    "text": "Come on, their deaths was a clear case of foul play. \ni) Lisanne was an avid writer in her diaries and communicated daily with her family. If she felt her time was up or felt she was in mortal danger, she would have recorded something on her camera as a final message to her family, not make some useless shots in the dark. Those shots were probably attempts by the murderer(s) to make as if the women were still alive, false clues. \nii) Bones - so let's assume they did succumb to their injuries or from starvation and illness, why have there been only a few scattered bone fragments found. What happened to the large bones and their skulls. Could the river have been so weird to wash away these large bones but not those other smaller fragments? Certainly, there are no animals in that jungle that would devour whole skulls? \niii) The tour guide. It's very convenient isn't it that the tour guide is the one that just happened to be the one to come across the bone fragments. Wasn't this guide alleged to have been in the womens' room at some point during the incident, for what reason? I also recall reading that the guide had some kind of ranch (more like a shack) nearby the trail and this was later DEMOLISHED. \niv) No mention of the mysteriously deleted photo from the camera? No one in distress is going to take the time to delete a particular photo from their camera. \nv) If it wasn't the tour guide, it certainly is possible the women ran into drug mules..\nvi) How were the contents of the backpack and the bag itself dry and intact (see the photos) if they were supposed to be out in the wet and damp jungle? \n...among other questions. \n\n\nMy guess is, yes the women initially strayed from the trail and got lost hence the attempted calls but then one or more predators who either chanced upon them or were actually following them all along, took the women by force and brought them somewhere, and then days or weeks later disposed of them leaving some scattered bone fragments and some of their belongings - which the inept investigators didn't bother to question.",

And the jeans were by a ravine so they had access to water and humans can live without eating (if they have access to water) for far longer so if one of them was injured, the other one would have been able to fill the empty bottle and carried it back to her. And if one of the theories was that the uninjured one went to find help, why didn't she take their phone and camera with her and to top it all, why were their bones found together??? And where is picture 509?!?!? Also the backpack was in good shape yet their remains were almost non existent. I know that the animals probably snacked on their remains but why was there so little bones found with one still having skin on it and the other was bleached I'm assuming by the sun! I've never heard of this case and now it's going to drive me crazy! Ugh. At least their poor parents have an answer of sorts so they can grieve for if they had no answers, that would be more painful and they wouldn't have had closure. May the girls Rest In Peace and prayers for their parents.",

That assessment is also, by and large, absolutely wrong. However, it rarely hurts to take extra precautions or to remain partially weary of your new surroundings, at least initially. While traversing terrain you’re not familiar with, in a country you’ve never been with a language you don’t fluently speak, it may be best to warm up to it all a little bit before allowing yourself to be fully immersed. \nAnd I am in NO WAY blaming those young women for the horrors that befell them. The only thing they are guilty of is, perhaps, being too optimistic or trusting. But they did not deserve one iota of what happened to them, but there situation is one that, unfortunately, future young travelers can learn from.",

I feel that plays a part in all of this. \nI think it's to do with those two men. \nThe were two men in this story and they could've over powered the girls easily. \nAs they say, it was impossible for them to have got lost half a mile from the guides house. \nThese were bright girls were not talking about two dumb idiots. \nIts Definately foul play. \nThe girls were just round the corner from the guides house they were not lost. \nThe walked from the guides house. This was not there very 1st big trip  away they were clever girls. \nSome thing stopped them getting back to the guides house and walking the half a mile back to the guides house. \nHad they have been miles out the way then I'd get the whole getting lost theory but they weren't miles away they were half a mile away from the guides house which is basically around the corner, \nSomething stopped them getting back there it's definate foul play.\nIt's could've been that they were attacked and one girl was fatally injured, while the other girl played dead then when she could she tried to take photos for light at night time.\nThere's alot more to this. I Beleive it was covered up so that this case did not affect tourists that travelled there. \nR.I.P to the girls",

No teeth bruise, scars on them. I can say it is bcos  the cannibal who skinned them and dismembered the body, had experience in butchering. (Nearly 50 gals and few men were disappeared b4) remember a clean butcher.\n2. Night photos: i suppose they werent taken by kris or lisanne. They were surely photographed by tribes bcos we can note the way they were taken. Some1 who doesn't know how to handle camera. Kris' hair image must have  been taken after the scalp peeling.\n3.backpack: after days it was found to us. Who will throw away a 83dollar.. A man eating people and living in caves/hideouts will definitely not need money. \nThen, kris' bones were found gathered in a place along with other men bones. This tells they dispose bones just like we throw trash in the can.\nAlso, lisa foot and fingers were found somewhere.. They were not fleshy We know. \nI found these when i glanced. If druglords or smugglers were involved, they would have not left bodies unburied or burnt.",

There was cellular reception at the summit of the volcano and along the entire path so the emergency calls not getting through was obviously staged, invalidating all of that \"creepy\" sequence of calls to emergency services.",

I never been so cut up, sore and distraught. We tried to base a position off of our google maps to avoid calling 911 but we ended up getting split up and everyone’s phone eventually died except one guy. So we all huddled together, called 911 and gave our compass location. They honked to give us perception of the road. When we got out we had to wait another hour for them to find the that split from us. It was that easy for a group of us to get lost in a forest, I couldn’t imagine just two people in a jungle with actual predators and mountainous areas... For reference, the area was about 200 acres, if I had to guess. We would’ve gotten out eventually in the daytime we just didn’t want to “rat ourselves out” being dumb teens. Worth it for the story in my case.",

And then the backpack ends up outside of some village somewhere else? The only thing that makes it seem like they are still alive is the 911 calls.

He walked up a footpath/trail for a couple minutes exploring.  Couldn't find his way back.  He was with a group of more than 10 other people, one was a guide, he got lost in minutes, and he never left the trail.  There were just so many forks and turns he couldn't find his way back.  If you don't have a compass or know how to navigate, the jungle is dense and you can get lost easy.",

Because of this, I find it hard to even imagine what those poor young women were going through and, oftentimes, I don’t even want to try to think about it. They at least had each other initially but I can’t think that that would even bring much solace considering the situation they were in. It’s one thing to find yourself a little lost during daylight hours, although it’s still nerve racking nonetheless, but during the day you at least have some recourse. It’s infinitely more possible that you might come across a fellow hiker or that you’d be able to get your bearings in the light of day. Unfortunately it seems like these poor women never got the opportunity. And while in most true crime cases finding the body or remains is usually looked at as positive evidence for the prosecution, in Lisanne and Kris case the finding of their belongings and shortly thereafter their skeletal remains, definitely brought up a lot more questions then it did answers. I pray that their families do get answers soon. I can’t imagine what they’re going through.    💔 💔 💔",

Often the weather changes over the course of the day - sunny and mild in the morning, changing to heavy storms or high winds in the afternoon. It's easy to lose your balance. Non-locals are treated very well here (tourism fuels the local economy) but there is poverty all around which is why non-locals can be targets at times for robbery or worse. Two women alone on a quiet trail could be easily subdued. I can vouch that cell phone service in this area is spotty at best unless you are near the town or a tower. One truth about Boquete is you have to plan here to get here. Nobody can reach it by accident. It's attractive to many who come from all over the world for its fantastic climate and international flavor but it is still a remote location with many hazards not encountered often in North America or Europe.",

If they will really lost it probably all things inside will be one big mess, also dont understand why all things were arrange inside, if I will be lost in some jungle and dont know what to do I wont care about things like that and eveeything will be mess inside. Also inside backpack people find some snacks and another question, why the hell it was there? They didnt eat anything for 10 days? Its not make sense you need eat something it will give you energy.. how it possible that people find this backpack after 2 months? But this place is so popular many people go there so nobody looking near river? I dont belive in this story because if they dissapear there of course people looking for them and check every piece of that place and in my mind river is important thing to check so what nobody saw backpack before and miracle it appear after 2 months? What else didnt make any sense? The fact that they hire a guide they paid him they arrange meeting at 2 april and the time everything, but they decided to go there day before? Why? Why go to some place when you know you will go there tomorrow with guide..",

They intentionally place markers on an impromptu trail to ensure they aren't going in circles, or, if they can't find the real trail, as a way to get back to a familiar spot. Eventually they die from exposure. Scavengers ravage the bodies and scatter their remains all throughout the canyon. If I were a betting man, that's what happened.",

There's no fun seeing what everyone else has already. I think the truth is clear here. So, so sad. The phones were being turned off to conserve battery life. Like Mike said, the other girl was most likely trying to get into her friend's phone and didn't know the code. The pictures were either taken because they had the flash light on to navigate, and were accidents, or they were an attempt at a message or both. They were in a ravine where service - IF AVAILABLE AT ALL AROUND - would have been nil. Try calling someone from the bottom of a 90 foot waterfall gorge; won't work. I KNOW. As far as the backpack, the items were inconsequential, and not needed for what they were doing and up against. Sounds to me like the local found it shortly after, took it inside, kept it, and only reliquished it weirdly so as not to be implicated because they were scared. That's why it was so nice still. Total accident. It's clear.",

Been explained by natural elements. \n\nAs someone that has recently gotten into hiking maybe this can offer some insight..... we have smart phones and such. I like to take picture, check the saved maps I have on my phone to make sure where I am. It's real easy to walk off a normal trail when doing this. It's like those people in the city checking their facebook amd walk into a crosswalk when they dont have the walk light. Accidents can easily happen due to us not paying attention to our surroundings.",

It really surprises me also that some people say this was a popular spot for drug dealers. Which spot exactly? The whole jungle? You don't have to be Pablo Escobar to know that the heart of the jungle, well, it's not the best place to do business.

I stopped listening to the armchair idiots who over analyze EVERYTHING, and watched videos of the people who have actually hiked this very dangerous trail.  I also listened to the FACTS, not speculation or RUMOUR. Watch videos of people crossing Monkey Bridges, EVERYTHING points to an accident plain and simple. The clothes were not found folded and dry, the ball of skin rolled up was lie, If you truly look at the FACTS nothing else, these girls fell into the river or one had an accident and the other died trying to get he out. Look at the mud on their clothes, means they already fell once before.",

Maybe Kris slipped again and hit her head.\nThen the photos could have been her hearing/seeing searchers/helicopters, and using the flash of the camera to try to get attention.",

The  taxi driver who drove the girls to the pianista (mountain walk)died in mysterious circumstances a year later.(drowning  accident in two feet of water)heres the link to the video of the family walking the same path.start about 8mins ,not much before that of much  interest.https://youtu.be/cOyg5Qloz7o",

I don't know what to think really.... Its creepy either way. Poor girls RIP...\nIt appears the town or village know more than they have let on to authorities. Also, we are missing some of the photos. The public have not been shown everything that was on their phones right? So we don't get the full story or picture as it stands. I've seen this case done by other YouTubers before but I like the way you present it and the extra information you provide. I didn't know about the false pincode attempts  and 77 emergency calls. Someone was in a panic... 😔😨😢😑💐❤️💔😳😨 Wait... if they werent met with foul play then how the hell did their bag just \"appear?\"  the people in the village have some explaining to do....\nThe backpack was dry insyde but the girls remains were scattered possibly by animals eating at the bodies... It doesn't seem like it was just a horrible accident. Cellphones even in the olden days of 2014 (Lol) have worldwide emergency calls only if a phone is locked. Those 77 attempts weren't to 111 ,999  911 or any other emergency directory. Someone took pics and made calls. They were stolen from including their lives",

If they were murdered, why were they given access to their phones to make emergency phone calls and why were the flags tied around the branches? Why were they kept alive so long? Why wasn't the dog murdered too? Yet why weren't the bones found to have evidence of animal teeth marks and how did two seemingly intelligent girls get themselves lost in a jungle? I'm leaning towards foul play, considering that they were attractive, white, and young.  The one girl with a bloody head could have been hit by somebody, so maybe they were trying to run away from that person - who chased them into the jungle. They ran so far they couldn't find their way out? I would like to see more forensic evidence on the bones because I think they would tell the story. I'm really spooked by this one. The world is not a safe place and evil has always been a part of our species. I think in modern times we don't always recognize that, but just be careful out there.",

No... a third party was trying to use the phone, the stuff that was found was spread out and the backpack didn't hide itself!! Not to mention their bodies torn apart completely and in pieces... no way!! My guess is they became targets for a kidnapping or something, got scared, maybe tried to hide from someone and eventually were found by the wrong people!!!! There's just too much that doesn't fit them lying down and dying!!",

    "text": "My best guess has to be maybe the dog got away from them some how and they were frantically searching for it because it was owned by the people they were staying with and didn't want to explain to them how they lost their dog. It was the beginning of their 6 week stay and it would of made a uncomfortable and tense rest of their stay. Maybe even thought they would of been told to leave. Not knowing that the dog would of made its way back on its own. That's the only thing that really makes any sense to me anyhow as to why they would go off trail and probably got lost and took a long walk off a short cliff accidentally since it was dark and they were lost... The back pack showing up with everything seemingly intact with the girls phones still in working condition (albeit with dead batteries) is one of the things that are strange and mind boggling. Also all photos that are taken on cell phone cameras have a gps longitude and latitude position automatically hard coded in the pic itself. I'm guessing that they probably didn't know this since most people don't. They could of tracked there route quite easily if they did... However this video is a year old and I doubt I get any feed back from it. I just recently found this channel!",

The other was probably compromised in such a way that trying to leave or call out for help was impossible (the signal never being strong enough). Someone mentioned the photos being taken could possibly have been an attempt at catching the attention of search and rescue. The markers could have simply been one of them trying to also catch the eyes of rescue workers. IDK why people constantly go on about it was foul play. I think because reportedly, one of the photos had been deleted. But really, anything could have happened.",

There was no way to get lost out there.  The trail is used daily by tourists, it is well worn and marked.  There are signs saying this is the end. Trail not maintained and do not continue . Even if they did continue... the backpack was found about 5 miles from the end of the marked tourist trail.  They would have passed at minimum 3 established areas where they would find people if they had made it as far as the backpack  They also would have had to cross a monkey bridge which is a wire you walk on with two wires at hip level you use to stabilize yourself. This bridge is 45 feet in the air.  It just makes no sense",

The host family did not realise they were not in and had left their breakfasts as normal.\nThe police immediately went into action both in Bocas and Boquete, checking cctv, interviewing people and taking the pc away from the Spanish school etc.\nThese poor girls died horribly, but I don't suspect foul play.\nThe treacherous terrain and deadly rope 'bridges' (lethal) were sufficient to cause terrible injuries.\nThey had strayed so far off the trail that they were actually heading back across the jungle towards Bocas.\nI was and am still here, there is much missing in the story but not generally anything to alter the overall narrative.

    "text": "Regarding night picture : \n\nI think that the night picture are not from 8 april but from 2 april first night the girl spent lost.\nThey need light but they dont want to use phone to keep the battery .\nThen they use the LCD screen to get some few light.\nOff course thay dont use the camera on daylight to keep camera battery in case they still have to psend another night. \n\nI think they , probaly Lisanne, change the date by mistake without doing it on purpose touching the knob around the screen in the dark. It happend to me even in normal condition.\nAnd they are in the dark ;cold place, with fear , no food , no drink, no equipment, and realising that they told nobody that they decide to go there.\n\nThey dont try to show US something, they just use the camera to help THEM to find a way.\n\n Then it would explain that sometimes its dry , and then become rainy as the meteo change during the night. Also explain the mirror and paper still dry and hair of Kris dry and clean. \n\nThey are totally lost, and maybe, but not sure, 1 of the girl is injured. \n\nI really think its the key of those picture : THIS IS THE FIRST NIGHT, they are lost, nobody still looking for them.\n\nSCENARIO\n\n 1/ after the mirador they go to snake trail side but not for no reason : they intend to go top the hidden falls. \nIf i understand well, to go there, you need to quit the trail and go threw the jungle until you can find the falls.\n\n2/ they quit the trail BUT they get lost and never find the falls. But they also do not found the way back to the trail inside the jungle. They are lost. This is the moment they try to call emergency with phone because they realise that nobody knows where they are.\n\n3/ Times passes, night fall. They have nothing to eat, drink and no equipment. But they are still in good condition so they keep trying to find the way. Then they probably found the river cause of the noise maybe. Then they follow the river but they have off course no idea of the direction.\nThen they arrive to a place where they find a monkey bridge. And this is the place where they take many night pictures not for US but to help them how to climb in one of side of the brigge cause then , they can find a trail : If there's a bridge, then there's a trail. \n\n\n\nBut if finding a bridge is finding a trail , that trail has 2 direction , boca de l toro or bokete.\n\nThey put this kind of sign on the stone to try to understand  the direction they might take . Also have a piece of paper coming  probably from the map we can see lisanne gat in the restaurant.\nThe picture with hte mirror and paper, maybe they empty the bag to find something, the map from the restaurant for ex, or the red plastic bag was inside the backbag and they empty this red plastic bag to use it.  \n\nThey use plastic bag red piece to indicate the river direction, and the other red piece to indicate the monkey bridge. They try to find the right direction according to the map. \n\n\n 4/ What happen after, still a question, they climb on one of the side, but it was difficult in the dark thats why they use flash. Then they start to take a trail .  They maybe from that bridge choose a side to take the trail but the direction was boca del toro direction, not bukete. Is it that after they meet bad poeple or they just keep lost themselves and finish to die ? Dunno. \n\nThe question is which monkey bridge they found ? How many monkey bridge in this area ? Hwow many hours did they follow the river ? \n\n\nAnyway,  i think that later some locals might have found their bodies and stole them taking the bag, and all clothes including the Bras (so maybe can be a woman local who find the body, this kind of bras quality you dont find in jungle, a poor woman could have wish to keep them). \n\nAnd maybe they hide and keep the naked body in the jungle. The mother nature did the job . That would explaij why we found a part of the body spreading around boca del toro.Then , as the story become an international affair, they decide to spread the rest of the girl in many place so that poeple can recover them and stop thinking girls are alive. As for the bag, they do same but they didnt realise that a bag cannot be that clean only if someone stole it. But they cannot told the truth that they have stolen dead body , and hise the body without telling anything. \n\nI saw the poeple of the village look very unhappy ccause after they found the bag, they receive no money......They are stuck cause they do not kill the girl but cannot tell the truth.",

I’d imagine they were both injured, can’t imagine just staying there if you can walk as you'd be doubling your chances of getting help for both of you. But let’s not act like we’d be thinking 100% calmly & rationally or just end up making the right choice in retrospect. \n\nI imagine someone picked up their backpack not having any idea what it could be tied to. Then dropped it when it was annoying to carry—I do that with cool nature finds. I think either: “this is too annoying/cumbersome to travel with”, or “maybe I shouldn’t be moving this rock” or whatever. \n\nThe thing w/the bras is a little weird. Id imagine they may have had swimsuits on & took them off, especially with their shorts found folded. Seems like they changed into their suits/adjusted in prep to go swimming & then something happened. Or that they wanted to leave something identifying behind in case someone took their phones in the pack they probably put together to hopefully be found. \n\nThe 77 calls is really upsetting.",

    "text": "My theory: Froomes likely fell and either died or sustained massive injuries.\n\nKremers maybe tried to move Froomes (dead or alive) trying to call for help but eventually realised she would have to leave her (Froomes probably dead at this point)\n\nKremers then wanders through the pitch black jungle with both phones, constantly checking for signal and battery (didn't know code to Froomes phone?) \n\nShe probably fell in the dark and hit her head and tried to take a photo of it to check how bad it was. She also left markers to try and lead people back to Froomes body.\n\nUnfortunately in the dark and emotional state kremers probably also fell and was badly injured, or maybe her head injury got worse and she started to wander in circles.\n\nSounds like a tragic accident.\nThe lady saying the backpack wasn't there the day before maybe just missed it the day before and as for the theories that they deleted a photo it was probably just a reflex.\n\nIf you take a shit photo of something it's almost instinct to delete it if its all blurry.\nShe probably did this once, realized what a waste if battery it was and didn't do it again.",

    "text": "I have seen all the videos about this case that can be found. One thing that is remarcable is the idealization by europeans about the tropics, sine 1492. That is a long history. In that toughts the tropics were seen as paradise without knowing the flora and fauna that had diseases. That idealization by the girls had a price. If you are in Europe and you go in a pine forest in Denmark where i live you soon get lost and begin going in circles. Without a compass and a map (and knowing perfectly how to use them) you are lost. Happily the nordic forests in a flat country are not scarry....As a latinamerican living 35 years in Venezuela i was deep in coastal jungle but my common sense did not got me lost. As an european child  too i got lost in a pine forest near Copenhagen and remembered that very well. Conclusion no. 1 : The girls had NO  exploration experience of ANY KIND. Netherlands is flat.  They had a compass and left it in the hotel. The idealization of the tropics did the other part. Comment no.2: If one person got lost in that jungle, and had a camera , WHY not try to leave a message fotografing a simple message written in the earth with sticks or with stones on a big rock: \"Sorry dad & mom, we got lost!\"  Once you realize that you are going to DIE in the forest ...Why not trying to clarify what did happen ??? Conclution No.2: The individuality and proudness of the european avoids to think in other persons that are not themselves !!  Why not being honest and  take pictures to their family with a message??  Not that cryptical foto ALONE. (By the way that picture says one of us fall to a lower place from a height) If i was terminally lost i would have written a 1000 words written on the soil or composed a long message with stones and PHOTOGRAPHED IT for posterity. WHY they could not do that in 8 days??",

    "text": "Wait a second. I still don't understand. So this is what they think probably happened. They made the conscious decision to go off trail for x reason, fell into a ravine or gully, were injured, unable to climb out, and died of exposure to the elements. So then how the hell were the bodies dismembered like that? How did the backpack show up in a ricepatty dry and clean after a lot of time had passed? Why wouldn't they be more clear with the photos on top of using the camera flash for light? Why wouldn't they record a video or voice recoding explaining what happened in case they don't make it out and someone finds their phones? If I were hurt in a jungle unable to get help, I would prepare for the worst and at least record a video for my family telling them what happened to me and saying goodbye to them. None of this makes sense. What makes more sense is they were chased, murdered, dismembered, and the parts were spread out in an attempt to dispose of the bodies. The killer left the backpack in the ricepatty and the night photos were done by the killer as some game or to help them see how to get to the kill site. What do you think?",

Why a deleted photo, why not make a video, why was the backpack in such good condition, why were the bones all over the place?\nMy guess: they stumbled upon a 3rd party or parties, snapped a photo, were held captive, hurt, at least one escaped, photos taken by unknown party (could explain lack of video), killed and the parties responsible could be possible cannibals, as reports have come out that they live in that same jungle, which is why the locals don’t tangle with them.  This would also explain why bones were all over the place....the wild animals there walk on two feet!!",

What happened to make the dog abandon them? A dog typically will not abandon the person's they are with. Why didn't they think to follow the dog out of the jungle? They seemed like clever girls. Did the dog go off trail/leash forcing them to look for him? Is that how they got lost? If not then what caused the girls and dog to separate? Foul play?",

They were obviously lost and perilously trying to find their way out. They were not met with foul play but instead they were victims of their own failures. Neither of them were prepared enough for the circumstances that befell them. They decided to hike in the jungle where any number of dangerous situations could arise and carelessly they ignored all precautions and set out on an adventure they would not return from. There wasn't one situation  in particular that brought about their demise, instead it was a series of events that they were unprepared for that led them to a horrible ending. Had they taken even the smallest precautions before they left they most likely would have made it out of there with at least their lives.",

    "text": "all right so I've cracked this case what happened was is that the evidence was tempered by the locals and the murderer was covered up by the local government because they're involved somehow they're covering up his sexual murder that occurred so what happened really was the tour guy was basically stalking his victims and he is a female predator and so he set these girls up he knew that they would go another route let me ask you this ifthe search party took so long for them to search the area how come the tour guy knew exactly where the girls were all the time when they got lost he was looking for them he knew where they were and the flesh and the boot that were found had no decomposition did compositing of water to the shoe which means their bodies were hacked up by machete in the jungle.so that it was made to look like an accident that's why you found the backpack because the real killers was the tour guy and his son.and what they did was was they sexually raped and murdered these girls and then tampered with the evidence and made it look like an accident but it was no accident because if one of their boots or the foot was in the water. You would have had the boot decomposed d compositing from the water and that's not what it looks like it looks like the boot was fresh and the flesh was in the water which is very strange and so I know for a fact that you're a guy after the girls went missing he went to the room and tampered with evidence so this guy's arm of major prime suspect for The disappearance of these girls and I believe these girls were murdered by the tour guy and his son and they tampered with evidence and they had the locals they use their credibility and they had the police on this side which is conspiracy of Panama government which means the Panama government is behind this murder because they're covering up rapists and Killers like the tour guy that sets up these women in these hostels get some out and remote areas rapes them and murders and gets away with it and then campers with the evidence you saw the backpack was found that was planted by the predators to throw off the investigations but I know for a fact when the girls weren't messing the tour guide knew where they work and he could have found them at any point in time when they did go missing which means he was responsible he was covering it up so he is the the perpetrator I figured this case out and I know because the perpetrator made a trail holes and lies in the story so,the tour guy lied about everything and you found the backpack because he planted it perfectly that doesn't make any sense the backpack was found by locals and the shorts were found by locals the bones were found by locals and there was scattered which means they were murdered in the most gruesome Way by machete they were chopped up and they were raped tortured and murdered and the perpetrator used all of their evidence against it the public to show that it was an accident and it was no accident it was a cover-up the man is completely a serial rapist killer in Panama he is a Panama rapist killer and he likes white girls",

If you're lost, first rule is stay put, second rule is don't walk around at night, especially in dangerous terrain.  It would have been pitch black out there, and I just don't believe for a second they would have continued walking in those conditions.  Not to mention, they must have known that constantly using the flash would have drained the battery much more quickly.  The smartest thing they could have done as soon as they realized they were lost is to just hunker down, don't go any further, and wait for rescue.  Or for heaven's sake, follow the dog back!  Also the fact that the backpack was found next to water, in perfect dry condition and where it hadn't been the day before.  Plus Mike didn't mention it, but there's a very suspicious \"guide\" who was involved as well.  Also there's something else.  If you have a camera and/or a phone that takes pictures, it would be very easy to leave information for anyone who might find it.  Just write something in the dirt and take a picture of it.  The whole thing about these obscure \"clues\" they left, like an arrow that barely looks like an arrow, is ridiculous.  You could easily make a very recognizable arrow out of twigs or stones  if you wanted to.  Why leave something that could be so easily misinterpreted or missed?  Absolutely nothing here makes sense; it's almost like a third party was trying to throw everyone off.  No question foul play was involved in this case.",

    "text": "I dont beleive that even 1 of the girl can survive until 11th April WIHTOUT FOOD??????\nCome on, even they drink water from river , without food, fear, darkness, lost, .\nAnd how come they would have cross nobody during 10 days as it is clear that they are near a monkey bridge. And many poeple looking for them.\nAnd the bag , they found money, camera, 2 smartphone and 2BRAS ?? Does it mean that its a tradition in holland, when you are about to die, you take out your bra ?? Srly ??\nOr it means that both girl have decided to take out their Bra ? Here i ask girls to answer : is it possible.\nYou have no equipment, the situation in the dark , rainy, fear, maybe injured and YOU TAKE OUT YOUR BRA???? Or they use the bra for something ?? To link something around Lisanne legg ? They use the bra as link ? \n\nMy theory is that Lisanne in the dark change the day of the camera by mistake, then this night picture are from 2nd April. \n\nThen maybe they die the way you describe in your movie but then, bodies are discoverd by local probably, some local take the cloth and bag cause its a high value for poor local people. \n\nMaybe even they just hide the bodies or burie them in the jungle cause, as they have stolen their belongs, they can not let someone discoverd 2 naked girl . To me if there's mistery is those poeple fault, if they just call autorities after they found the dead girl, we could have known the truth. \n\nMaybe it is still possible to convince someone to tell where the balance of the remains are buried. \n\nAnyway, later they come back to take some part of the bodie and spread them to \"tell\" that the girl was dead : no need to search anymore. And they also put the bag back. \n\nThey cannot tell the truth cause they have stolen the girl after their death and they probably also buried the corps. \n\nThen i agree that maybe the police delete the picture 509 by mistake. Even the document where they list picture number they made mistake as they put 2013 instead of 2014; \n\nI agree the last picture of the girl after the mirador show that  Kriss is not having fun anymore. Probably already lost. It is confrimed by the fact that Kriss never take Lisanne in picture. Which is strange cause before, and when they are in mirador, each girl try to take photos of each other which is normal , they want record and souvenir. The last picture is probably to try to recognise the way. \n\nAs for the phone, i think that local who stole them try to use them.\n1 was injured, Lisane i think, broken feet. Maybe she falls just after the photo 508 as she is up and take photo from Kriss who is down. Then lisanne might have fall and broken her foot.\nThen they move but very slowly. Later this is Kriss who lead and try to find the way and she fall an die.\nThen Lisanne is alone, exhausted, and hopeless. Then she die.",

    "text": "What about the clean cut severed foot aka machete of Kris, deleated photos , photoshopped photos of Lisann with her breasts being 2 diff sizes and one pic her arm is of a masculine man aka TOUR GUIDE who invited them back to his spot overnight and they declined. He was the LAST person to see them alive and the FIRST one to find the bones, \nnot the taxi driver. The taxi driver was killed sometime after this happened aka we don't want u to talk, repeated failed passwords to Kris's phone.  Kris's hair was so dry from all that rain they endured...He probly took them in there , they fell or one did , he probly assaulted them , left them to die, could have led them to his spot and assaulted them and they tried to get away but couldn't get out of there and got hurt. This could have been planned from the minute they got out there. Hes a tour guide and couldn't find them for how long and he knows that place like the back of his hand. I think that is his arm in that photoshopped pic of Lisann and Kris. I think the reason why Kris looked so different in the picture of her on the Rock in the water is because he might have started acting a certain type of way or had done something right then or  maybe someone else appeared and startled her like who is that? Or what is that? Kind of look. I think that they were probably attacked and or fell on April 1st the day of and then just left to rot and then he and came back and dismembered them to rid of any evidence. The dry backpack that was just so neatly placed in a rice patty is super sus but wasn't there before and that clean-cut of Kris's foot cannot be caused by a fall it reminds me of something a machete would do. It's the perfect crime because it's the perfect place. Look at the Tour Guides eyes in his pics its very unsettling to me and always has been in his pics and the fact that he hits on the women the tourists that come there is a red flag too and I really think that he did it and it's probly not his first rodeo. And they are not gonna let that get out or they will lose money hence the taxi drivers mysterious murder after this happened and the 2 fellow Dutchmen they befriended while there were killed too. Easy enough to deem that an accident seeing as how that happens there easily. Yes it could have been simply a fall for one or both but the sick, corrupted shit that goes on in places like these people still need to take in consideration. Especially when it involves 2 young , beautiful, tourists that we're out there alone. Up to 30 fingerprints found on that camera, complete shit show of an investigation and that damn tour guide it all gives me red flags.",

    "text": "I always feel so much for the Parents and immediate family and friends where these two are concerned, as apart from their enormous irreplaceable loss they live on with the haunting reality that they can never have answers to the many questions that surround Lissanne and Kris' last days.\n\nIn all probability is a case of misadventure. Two more hikers who got wandered off too far and got into trouble wen they realised they were lost, and yet even though I accept that as what most likely happened I also have to confess that there are aspects to some of the evidence that cast doubts for me as well.\n\nThere are an awful lot of assumptions made online as to what happened and WHY it happened with these two, but all we can be sure of is that the two set off to the top of the Pianista and made an impressive photo-diary of doing so - it is possible to follow them from the base of the hill right to the top - and beyond as they begin to drop down the other side. Tellingly the photography stops as they reach the first stream, and yet every guide who has taken that route agree that you simply cannot get lost here, nor indeed for some considerable way as the route progresses. So the clear question is why it is Lisanne stops taking photos of Kris at this point...? \nWhen you review the photography up the hill you can glean quite a bit of information - the two are seen to be sharing carrying the backpack for example, sharing in the photography too. As they reach the top Lisanne has let her hair down while Kris puts hers up. As they drop down the other side it is clear that for at least the next hour it is Lisanne who carries the backpack and is taking the Photos, while Kris is anything up to thirty feet out in front. If you think on that it might suggest some tension at play between the two - Lisanne is the one with some experience at hiking and adventure forays, she probably understands that what they are doing here is rather risky, so does this suggest that she has some doubts and reluctance to be dropping down into this unknown and increasingly difficult territory? If she was the one who let her hair down as they summited the Pianista it suggests that reaching the top was the mission accomplished, that exploring the other side was never the intention. So perhaps Kris being filled with enthusiasm and adrenaline by this point pushes the notion of just taking a quick look over the other side, and keeps going. Lisanne is increasingly not happy as they progress and by the time they reach the stream-crossing her doubts and frustrations over Kris' storming ahead lead to her packing the camera away as she has to concentrate her full energies on keeping up with her partner...\n\nThat's all just a theory I stress. The fact that there are no further pictures beyond the stream crossing is one of the significant points to this case, and while I think the above is a credible scenario to explain it I also would like to think that if Kris was aware of her friends concern and unhappiness she would have stopped and agreed to retreat eventually. One has to accept as well that for Lisanne to stop all photography the situation had to be serious - bear in mind that it is still a good two or more hours walk from the stream to where the first calls were made to emergency services. So what could have been going on in those hours?\n\nThe other major concern for me is the call logs themselves. The timing and frequency is remarkable as for those first five or six days the calls and signal searches are made at roughly the same hours in the day - why? And why no switch-on at night, when the air would be clearer and a light source much comfort to two girls supposedly lost and sleeping rough in deep forest, in pitch black conditions....?\n\nYes, on the face of it a case of two girls getting lost in alien territory and paying the price for misadventure, but..... BUT.......",

Nexpro didnt even mention the head photo, just said a photo was removed from like the cloud not the phone itself tryin to make this tragedy more creepier for views imho. \nBut he also didnt mention the 2 mwn they had lunch with either so could be he just didnt do good enough research....🤔\nYou were 100000% more factual and level headed on this!! Thank you for all your hard work & dedication!!🖤👏🥂🍾🤗",

I'm pretty sure Kris' iPhone 4 would have had this app (Voice Memo was apparently intro'd with iOS 3). Of course, they would have had to do this early on, and early on I'm sure they didn't think they'd die. (If foul play was involved, then we know why no such memo was left, but I'm not entirely convinced there was foul play. The wilderness is a dangerous place.) Poor women. Must have been terrifying.",

I would think that they just thought it was a bad pic and deleted themselves ..... so MAYBE there was a lil more to story.... maybe they were chased into the jungle further and got lost. Cuz actual hands on murders just are not seeming that likely here.... this is def a REALLY STRANGE & SAD one to say the very least!!! 😿😨\nI was thinking myabe the missing photo nexpro mentioned was that head one to just amp up the creepy factor but now i dont think so.... my bad!!!🤦🏻‍♀️",
