    "text": "I have lived in Boquete the past two years (long after this happened) and one key to this, I believe, is the nature of the seasons in the area. From December through March, the afternoons are sunny and windy. From May through October, it is normally bright and sunny in the mornings but becomes rainy by 3 pm. Sometimes the storms are immense downpours that turn trails into streams. April is a month where the weather transitions from dry to rainy so there are sudden downpours on some days and no rain on others. I tend to believe that one of the two ladies was injured and both tried to call for help but there was no cell service in the area. They may have become disoriented by the fact that they could have crossed the continental divide so trekking downhill actually led them further from home, not closer. Neither of the girls were serious hikers, from what I have been told, and the trails in Panama can be rocky and treacherous, particularly in heavy rains. One or two wrong decisions may have sealed their doom.",

This was going to be dark soon. They didn’t know they would be lost/hidden for days... I would have called over and over again scared to sleep in jungle for the first night plus injury or lost. \n\n* • the camera - why would they have no photos of the two them together even if one was injured or lost. They could have done selfies together of where they were on the first night, again not knowing they wouldn’t be found? \n\n* Why have no further bones have ever been discovered? Noting that 3 natives bones were also discovered.\n\n* Backpack with things in it, why didn’t the need anything from the backpack with them? Whether camera, sunglasses, bras, water bottle? when they fall over or injured they just happen not to have these items with them at the time?",

I rarely watch the news in my country but when I found out about this I was glued to the tv for any update.\nThis is really very strange because the crimes against tourists are so low (perhaps the regular robbery) and even more in the country side when there are actually a lot of foreigners living in the area because it offers a cooler weather than the rest of the country and has a vast of green scenery. \nI remember a native girl in my class saying that some indigenous groups are more protective of their areas than others and they have strange practices but they are kept in the low to the rest of the world. \nOthers said that maybe they came across to some sketchy activities and were killed because of what they witnessed.\nSome people suspect the tourist guide that was supposedly going with them they canceled with him but I can't remember why, locals also  advice them not to go alone and if I'm not mistaken the guide went into their room as well after they went missing, don't know why the owner of the place they were staying allowed this.\nI personally don't know much of the area but I have gone sightseeing Chiriqui and other places around the country and the terrain can be very treacherous specially with our crazy weather where it can be sunny and the next minute is pouring, maybe one was injured and this added to the fact that they could have been lost is so scary.\nI get chills just thinking about what could have happened to them any of this scenarios is terrifying 😔",

He suggested it was the tour guide who was responsible. He said the 2 girls caught a taxi. The driver gave an inaccurate time for dropping them off. He was found drowned in shallow water a year later. He and the tour guide were 2 people who the girls supposedly told about their plans to go hiking. The video showed a review of the tour guide - from a woman who strongly recommended not to travel alone on his tour. She said he started touching her, and joked about cutting off her legs with his machete. The foot that was found had a clean cut, just like a machete would make. Also, the tour guide apparently has a coffee farm right where the girls were missing. AND he supposedly went to where the girls were staying, and conducted a search of their room, for 30 minutes, and he was alone in the room the whole time. What was he looking for? It goes to show, if the locals tell you it is unsafe to hike, listen to what they're telling you. I'm so sorry for what these young girls went through, and for their families having to live with this now, and without the answers and justice they deserve. I'm amazed that someone making a YouTube video can think to check out reviews for this tour guide, but the police did not. And I would be surprised if they, or the locals, don't know more than they are letting on. RIP Lisanne and Kris.",

The place where they went missing is in a rainforest which as well as any jungle in the province of Darien aka “green hell” by the USArmy troops that trained in jungle operations can tell you, is NEVER a place you want to just go trekking into without real knowledge of the terrain and experience in jungle survival procedures. I lived in Panama for over 3 decades and not once did I nor anyone else I know ever feel the least bit of inclination to enter the jungles/rainforests here. They were innocents thinking the jungles of Central America are the same as the forests back home….wish I could’ve advised them not to go into the rainforest at all. Plenty of dangers like fer de lances (vipers) and wild animals! My Dad taught at the Jungle Warfare Training Center at Fort Sherman(now defunct as all of US SOUTHCOM in Panama since 2000). Tragic!! God rest their souls. Que Dios los guarde y que le de Paz a sus familiares.",

The backpack would have been soaked, given they were in a rain forest and presumably, would have been found on one of them had they been lost. The sad reality is they possibly got lost, and met with a sad fate of someone who saw an opportunity. I’m going to guess that the night photos taken were of the murderer, not either girl. It was done to skew any investigation and confuse people. They are nothing more than random photos in the dark. The one deleted was reported to have been deleted via computer, which is also a red flag. \n\nVery well done video and my heart goes out to the family and friends of these young ladies.",

What did the searches think had happened that would have prevented their return but allowed them to remain on trail but apparently invisible? It's just ridiculous to me to think they were on the trail. If they were they'd have either never been missing in the first place or been found relatively quickly. I don't get it.\n\n\nEdit: the moment they knew they were lost they should have stopped moving. Walking for days in the wrong direction did nothing but seal their fate.\n\nVery sad 😔",

    "text": "I'm sceptical of the murder theories, although they're understandable, given past crimes involving young women hikers in foreign countries. I have myself been seriously lost in the woods twice, and once guided out a young woman lost in the woods at night while I was camping just off the Appalachian trail. Each time it was dramatic how fast disorientation and panic set in - it's the panic-fear that makes one automatically do the opposite of what one should do. It's not like your car's GPS stops working on a road trip. It's more like falling off a cruise ship and watching it disappear over the horizon. I can only infer that in the most serious cases, especially after days of food deprivation and chronic anxiety and stress, disorientation could become so severe that the two inexperienced girls in the Panama case would begin acting almost pathologically confused, while desperate hope may have led them to forego goodbye messages for the sake of attempts to reach local rescue until the batteries in their phones went dead and it was too late.\n\nI've watched a couple of the better pieced-together videos and I found myself getting sceptical of the murder theories when I saw too much bias in that direction. For example, some of the \"happy\" photos early on in their hike were slightly distorted or the clouds seemed mis-timed from one snap to the next or the one girl was supposedly a little depressed or anxious looking, and to me all that seemed overly subjective and irrelevant to any criminal activity. The idea of any killers allowing their victims to keep taking photos is ridiculous, not just because it creates possible evidence but because abduction and murder (rape also) is about having complete power and control over someone.\n\nWhy would a killer and not the girls turn the phones on and off? Only the girls had any reason to do that repeatedly, and if they had the chance to do so around an abductor, they also would have had the chance to escape. The backpack could have been misplaced by the girls in their disoriented state until a villager found and took it, then returned it, dry, to the same (or a different) spot once they got wind of rescue efforts for the owner of the backpack and realized it might implicate them in more than just “finders, keepers.”\n\nAs for the photos in the camera, how would taking dozens of photos of the sky at night serve to mislead police? And the height-distorted photo of Lisanne? Digital photos occasionally are goofy like that (I have a rear-view pic of my motorcycle where the panniers look like two different sizes). The clouds at the trail overlook completely mismatching in photos taken seconds apart? Weird, but how does that suggest foul play, when the girls are posing normally? The deleted photo? A tech-savvy killer would only take the batteries out of the phones and throw everything in the river or bury it all, making deleting photos unnecessary and also increasing the mystery to the killer’s advantage. Anyways, why disguise a murder as an accident, when both possibilities (murder or losing their way) are going to be speculated about regardless? I can certainly see the girls using the camera flashes to attempt signalling toward airplane sounds and checking for hazards in their path (note the one photo of a dangerous drop down a rock). Furthermore, why would a killer force-march two victims miles through a jungle, only to kill them in the middle of nowhere? That makes no sense - killers aren't lazy, but what advantage would there be to the killer?\n\nI think these girls just got hopelessly lost, and that leads me back to my own experiences of being lost in the woods - the more you try to guess your way out in a panicked and confused state of mind, the more lost you get. To me, the most important thing about this tragedy isn't how the girls died, but the decisions they made leading up to their disappearance. They'd worked hard as waitresses in the Netherlands to save for the trip and they were young, idealistic and eager, so it's understandable they'd be adventurous. But they'd already reached their goal of living in that small tropical town in Panama and they hadn't even seriously explored the town itself yet. They had a guided hike scheduled for the next day. What was the hurry to get into the jungle? Going to extremes is always a dangerous thing, and getting too adventurous too soon was going to an extreme. I think the girls were their own killers.",

It sounds like all these bonesvwete tossed out at the same time, maybe tossed out later so it be harder to determine cause of death, and to look like they just met with some kind of accident or animals got to their remains. I think they were abducted and forced off the trail, and maybe someone else who was also in trouble had access to their phones, because the idea they were somewhere were they were trying to call for help and the one friend didn't give the other one her phone, especially since the battery died on the other phone? I think maybe someone else had access to their phones but was a victim as well. The fact that their were other fingerprints on the bag, and it was disposed of. There should be a flashlight on the phone, so using their flash on their camera doesn't make sense, I guess to scare an animal is plausible, but because they were taken off the trail and the weird time. I'm guessing they were trying to take pictures of the landscape or things they left to try to identify where they were and that is also why they took a picture of the sky, maybe thinking it would identify where they were, if they had no service, they may have thought at some point they could try to leave their backpack with phones or camera in hopes that someone could find them.",

No female takes their bra off until they get home.  Unless the took off their clothes and went skinny dipping, which is absurd. I won’t even skinny dip in my backyard pool....never mind in some foreign country in the jungle with lord knows who is around watching. It’s not a normal thing to do. I feel for the parents.

Exploring and having many new experiences is something one has to take carefully. Young people, in general, do not know of the risks involved in that, anywhere in the world, let alone in places one doesn't fully are familiar with.It doesn't matter where you are in the world, if you are not from there you are exposed to all kinds of dangers. These two girls exposed themselves to a great deal of horribly situations, simply because they thought that the locals were \"friendly\". Locals are \"friendly\" all over the world until you find the not friendly one. From Toronto my heart goes to their loved ones.",

    "text": "In the disappearance of these two Dutch girls, there are two situations that I don't understand and I believe that need a more careful analysis:\n1-If in the first two calls to the Dutch emergency number, they were already under the control of kidnappers, why didn't the criminals take the phones, the camera and all their belongings?\n\nThis doesn't make any sense! No offenders with murderous or sexual intentions would risk being photographed by their victims, or even risk the girls calling the police or leaving a message recorded on their cell phones for when they are found by the authorities.\n\n2- Why don't you have any attempt to call 911 during the night?\n\nWhat would be the worst moment for two girls from an urban environment, lost in the middle of a tropical jungle?\nDo you agree with me that this worst moment would be to spend the night in the forest?! Exhausted, cold, with animals moving on the ground, animal movement in the dark forest, a plague of insects, rain spray, hunger, thirst and darkness everywhere. This would undoubtedly be the time when they would most try to connect to an emergency number, but they didn't.\n\nTrying to explain these two situations, the best way to harmonize was as follows:\nLisanne and Kris decided on their own, to continue the trail past the viewpoint, when they realized they couldn't make it back before nightfall, or because they really got lost and disoriented, they decided to make the first two calls in the late afternoon of April 1st. . Without success, they must surely have screamed for help. They were certainly answered and rescued by someone who heard them both scream, or someone who somehow passed them on the trail. This would explain why the girls did not attempt to call an emergency number during the night, that is, they felt safe to be accompanied by someone they believed to be trustworthy and well intentioned.\nAfter that, they certainly went with that someone, to some nearby property, where they continued to be deceived by lies that reassured them, but that at dawn and after a night's sleep, they always tried to make another emergency call, until the cell phone battery has discharged.\nIt was at that moment that this someone realized that they were totally incommunicado and certainly decided to attack and take their belongings that were all inside the backpack.\nFrom then on, all the evil that befell the girls began.\n\nIn my opinion, between the moment the last cell phone ran out of charge and the dawn of the 8th, Kris Kremers was killed, so in the photos taken on the 8th, only the hair of a lifeless body of Kris appears, trying to simulate a disappearance, with them lost in the night trying to signal their position in the woods and kris dead in Lisanne's arms (who doesn't appear in the photos) as it's the killer planting false evidence, not Lisanne!\n\nAs the pieces of Lisanne Froon's skin were found in mid-June, in an initial state of decomposition, this shows that Lisanne was killed in early June and was under the control of this someone who killed her, for about 60 days. She was the last to die.\n\nNote 1: Seeing the holes in Kris' Jeans, it shows that her dead body was dragged a short distance, where it was thrown. That is, this may indicate that the place where Kris and Lisanne were killed and the bodies were subjected to a chemical treatment for dismemberment and then concealment, are very close to each other, and may be in the vicinity of this property where they felt \"safe\" .\n\nNote 2: The photo of Kris' hair at night, may not have been photographed in the forest, but in a closed and dark environment.\n\nNote 3: Kris' boot found, was it clean and without any remains inside? No animal in the forest, would be interested in carrying a leather boot in her mouth! It's not food! That's how the animals would see this boot, any object, they would have smelled it and gone. That boot was taken to the forest by the killer.\n\nNote 4: The police know of more evidence, maybe even the photo that was deleted. At the very least, they want to make some strategic use.\n\nConclusion: Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon, were held captive in an environment they thought was safe, were killed, stripped naked, with the bodies being dismembered by some chemical process as yet unknown. Some dismembered parts, along with the girls' boots, clothes and backpack with all the girls' belongings, were deliberately abandoned along the straight-line trail to create false leads and simulate that the girls died of hunger and thirst after getting lost in the deep in the forest.\n\nThe death of these innocent girls touched me a lot! This is my small contribution to unravel their deaths and thus lead to a punishment, the possible murderer and the possible collaborators.\n\nFortaleza-CE, Brazil.\n\nI very much hope that Jesus Christ will comfort Kris and Lisanne's parents.",

Go forward or backward or even sit down and wait for somebody else to come along. Even reacquiring cell reception was far more likely to occur somewhere along the trail than some random direction into the jungle. i.e. It makes no sense whatsoever to voluntarily just wander off into the jungle\n\nFrom this, my own assumption would be that, someone must have at least scared them or chased them into the jungle in the first place. Perhaps this someone(s) caught up to them again sometime later,  but even if they didn't, it still caused their deaths as the girls were unable to find their way to safety again from that point.",

Very sad ending to two lovely girls that had their whole life ahead of them.\n\nSince watching this have been reading up and watching more about this case.\n\nI was caught between them being \"lost\" then \"abducted\" based on everything presented, but two things stood out for me me: 1) The photo of the branches with red or orange pieces of plastic tied to them and what looks like metal coloured bubble gum wrappers on the rock, and 2) The backpack and two bras.\n\nI don't think they were abducted at all.\n\nThe wrappers I reckon were meant to reflect the sun and all of it was to gain the attention perhaps of a plane, helicopter or someone with binoculars. The mirror too.\n\nAs for the backpack being miles away and in perfect condition means it was found weeks before and likely near the bodies - perhaps the bras were removed to be kept. No report made.\n\nIt seems there were tribe(s) living in the jungle so this could have been a tribal member that did it - like from the Ngabe Bugle. I was going to say I'm not too sure about cannibalism until I read that last year (2020) there was an incident of it with a religious sect, however, I think that is not their case in hindsight.\n\nI think someone came across their bodies and took the bag and bras only didn't report it. And as they made local and worldwide headlines the bag was placed somewhere to be found only nowhere were they actually died and maybe the bodies were brought closer so as to also be discovered.",

Just so police wouldn't be looking for a suspect. But, there were no photos of the faces. Why were no notes made in the phone, such as 'this is what happened to us...' Or even a sound recording of their voices? A frontal video recording? Yes, this would take up battery life, but a 5-second clip would have helped.  If they were alive, they owed that to their families, right??  A final goodbye. All phones have voice recording. The notes facility in the phone or at least one photo of a face would have shown us they were alive at that point. Regarding the hair, allegedly there was some visible blood on the back of the head hair. This is not confirmed but many people have come to this conclusion.",

Then where their bodies were found , well their remains ,3 different bodies were found also. Now what are the odds of 5 people being found dead in the same exact spot in such a huge remote area? The picture of the girls head scares me the most. Why is her hair that messed up? I understand being lost, hot, scared it’s dark your hair isn’t going to be combed but her hair was way to messed up to have been normal in any circumstances. Looks to have been dragged. It’s like her face is purposely being hid. I’m an Empath and I feel their terror it’s probably the worst I’ve ever felt from anyone. I hate to say this but I really feel in that picture she is already dead. I hated to say it I hate even feeling it but I can’t help it. I get terrible strange vibes from this story. Also their backpack is found in almost perfect condition with all their items in it. The woman that found it was pretty sure it wasn’t their the day before and they claim there is no way regardless that backpack and the stuff in it would have been in that good of shape out in the elements that it should had been in. Also to get where it was found they said that would have been a 14 hour walk. How did it even get there ? The way it was found out in the open with all their stuff inside makes me really feel it was put there on purpose to be found. I definitely feel and think that ,just why though? The dog that went with them came back the very same night but the girls didn’t makes me think it couldn’t have been far from where they started walking. It’s hard to think someone just sitting up in the woods all day hoping someone would come along for them to grab why I feel this person knew those girls where going to be there and alone.I don’t like saying sometimes what I feel especially when a case isn’t solved or half assed solved with so many questions. I know what I feel and the person has done this before . I’m not going to say anymore. The place they were staying needs looked at . The people in that house and who they know.This one does bother me. It’s the terror I can’t stop feeling from the girls. It’s just weird like I said just something isn’t right . I definitely don’t feel they just got hurt and lost and died from exposure. No no way.. I pray God will help the investigators so the family can find out the truth .",

The backpack was found after they searched the same area and in a better state than any other of their personal belongings\n2. The deleted picture was actually deleted from a computer so that's why it couldn't be recovered\n3. The bones were bleached with fosfurus a very sticky and dangerous chemical used in military grades weapons\n4. They reported they in their diary said they were being followed by a \"creep\"\n5. The skin was placed after the bones like they didn't have so much time for the skin to disintegrate so most likely their skin was put after they were murdered\n6. They weren't using the phone if you look at the phone calls there was one that actually connected but the person using their phone hung up and it lasted 1 sec, the killer most likely knew there was no signal\n7. The bones were actually found after they literally went trail up 3 times so like I said they were put up later\n8. The were actually other missing people after them and before them, in one of those were a german women who was lost and kept secret by their search party and raped she managed to escape\nso yeah.",

Maybe there wasn’t foul play involved and the girls were curious, got lost, injured themselves, and couldn’t find their way out of the forest in time. They died of natural causes. The other scenario would be someone else was lurking around in the woods while they were hiking, stalking them and maybe following them the entire time. Perhaps that individual lured them into the woods, which is why they didn’t turn around sooner. OR, after the girls decided to hike further, they ran into trouble after dark. Maybe someone evil was out and about after night and that’s when they were killed. Either way, they died somehow, and it’s horrible not knowing EXACTLY how it happened. Either curiosity got the best of them or they were attacked/killed.",

You have to make a life-or-death guess at the exact same time you realize what's happening and start to panic. I got lost like that in a Florida state forest following a false trail for 20 minutes. I miraculously picked the right direction and found an old logging/ranger road after a couple hours. But if I had gone with my first instinct, I could have easily vanished. You are either saving yourself or killing yourself, and you have no way to know which one you're doing. I still dream about it 20 years later. It's a special type of horror.\n\nALSO, I think the missing photo is explained by a good Samaritan. The image before the missing file is Kris's hair. I think Kris fell and injured herself badly, possibly even dying. Lisanne was trying to triage her in the dark by taking pictures. Because of her injury or otherwise grim appearance, the deleted image was shocking. As it would be traumatizing to the families, and the girls were already presumed dead, a nice person deleted it to spare them. Maybe the person who found the backpack or a government official.",

    "text": "It's interesting that the parents said “you can’t get lost on the path”. Videos from youtuber Romain C who walked the whole path and documented it show a different reality. It definitely doesn’t look clear and easy. Beyond the Mirador, especially after the first spring, the terrain is difficult and there are several animal paths (from cattle) that branch off from the trail. Finding the way on the paddocks also proved very difficult by other hikers who documented their journey.  \n\nThe backpack was not found in “perfect condition”. It was scratched and miscolored with holes and sand in it. One of the phones was severely water damaged. One reason why the contents weren’t more damaged from travel along the river could be that it was fairly light. Newtons law says two objects that collide exert the same force on each other. The rocks that the backpack undoubtedly bumped up against only exerted a minimal force on it, because of its relatively light weight. \n\nFrom the report: \n“The backpack was found in good general condition, but is dirty and contains several damages, which are listed below.\nThe attachment of one of the straps is partly loose.\nThe plastic closures contain deep scratches\nThe textile parts show signs of discoloration in various places.\nA rectangular piece of the fabric (approx. 30×15 mm) at the top right corner is missing. The edges of this damage are straight; they contain frayed fabric ends.\nA straight tear immediately adjacent to damage 4.\nThis damage is approximately 10 mm long and contains straight fabric ends on one side and on the other side the fabric ends are frayed. The fabric is discolored near this damage (as described in damage 3)”\n\n*The backpack contained a total of $88.30 USD, not $83.\n\n* The backpack was brought to the local village of Alto Romero before it was handed over to police, thus the DNA found on it (3 samples out of 13 taken contained DNA) could be from the villagers that handled it. \n\n* “77 attempts to call emergency services”. Not true, they tried 8 times.",

Love watching crime it's so obsessive. \n\nAs for the disappearance of those two girls that it hard to explain. \nFact that they tried several times to call for help proves summit bad happened but they didn't leave any scent behind where they were. Fact that some of their bones that were found were scattered over vast areas might explain animal activity.\nCos it's just a vast area & those girls didn't have a clue where they were I think they become disoriented & sucummbled to the elements which explains why they became lost miles from the path they were on that they got spooked by summit most likely animal activity but the fact that one of the girls rucksack was found in perfect condition & it's contents all neatly compact inside is very weird. Fact that nothing was wet in a rainy damp forest is very suspicious to me. Such a tragic strange case this one. Must've been terrifying for em knowing their last moments they were in a fight for survival",

    "text": "My theory on the backpack Along the trails and mountains in this area are small villages of \"Indians\" (some would call them Native Americans). These are not the same as the \"Anglo\" Hispanics that are most of the Panamanian population. These people are distrustful of Anglos and generally want nothing to do with them other than the money to be made from picking coffee beans in the farms when they ripen. Otherwise, these are impoverished people who haven't advanced much in hundreds of years. I have noticed, however, that they enjoy the obvious functions of a backpack and many wear them, including the children, because much of their transportation is on foot. I would not be surprised if one of them saw the girls' backpack after their disappearance and took it believing it was a freebie. They are largely insular people and cut off from civilization so they might not have even been aware that the Anglos were searching for the two girls. However, once they were told, a likely response would be to re-pack it and leave it where it could be found, rather than alerting authorities who might suspect them of kidnapping or killing the girls. This would explain how the backpack appeared where searchers had already looked. This would explain the fingerprints on the backpacks that were not the girls. Since they keep to themselves, it's unlikely police would have the fingerprints or DNA on file of the Indians to determine whose they were.",

They did a jungle trek spontaneously without a plan, did not wear appropriate clothing, did not bring enough water and food. Made a fatal decision to continue hiking past the summit. Called for help when they got caught in the jungle at dusk and had to stay there overnight but made a fatal decision to continue walking the next morning when fog hit and walked further and further away. One of them got injured, Kris broke her pelvis fell into a ravine and her best friend went after her but injured her foot on the way down. They couldn't escape and died of hunger, hypothermia, shock. Their dead bodies got swept by flash floods. If they had just stayed at the spot of their first call for help they would have been found the next day or 2 days later. Don't blame this on any cartel or indigenous people. Their multiple poor decision making proved fatal. They didn't respect the jungle and it's dangers.",

Was she not afraid of wild beasts or drug cartels ?  Any reasonable person prefers to finish the job in one day with an assistance .\nWhy did she choose to go there twice ?  \nI cannot believe and I think she was a liar. The backpack was passed to her by her boss ( the tour guide) because he wants the reward US$ 30,000.  If the Dutch parents did not offer any reward he would never turned in the backpack with its full content ? ( no room keys )\nMy theory 🎒💰only .",

Es sabido que en esos lugares no hay señal.Estaría en sus planes ingresar a la selva, vestidas con remeritas y shorts, siendo muy difícil transitar el lugar sin ropa apropiada, sin provisiones, y sabiendo que pronto iba a oscurecer? Me hago muchas preguntas, realmente en mi opinión no creo que ellas hayan tomado tales desiciones.Como se explica la aparición de su mochila intacta y a kilómetros? Y allazgos aún más terroríficos que ya todos sabemos...?",

But Hey the townspeople could have had it or it fell off during a fall into bushes. To be seen only by luck and an occasional downpour. Maybe it didn't stay in the river long at all.  It doesn't matter really, the family knows the girls at some point died due to the elements/animals after trying desperately to phone home. Nobody is looking for this phantom killer within the family or Panama. No conspiracy here. Just sad life and death.",

    "text": "Killed by a jaguar. There are regional governmental conservation efforts to protect the jaguar. Any official autopsy would tend to block jaguar predation as a cause. One of the last photos taken has been forensically modified to help brighten the picture. You can see a large cat. Leaving this picture on the phone was a fortunate mistake on the part of the first agency to view the photos. Any clear pictures of a jaguar would have been erased, before it was released to the public. The girl was smart to create as much of a reflective surface as possible to temporarily flash-blind the jaguar. From the summit point, one of the young women saw how easy it would be to travel along the river all the way to the north coast, rather than turn around. The ginger girl, in one of the later pictures, was really uncomfortable with the idea of following the riverbank. A jaguar's main hunting area is the riverbank. Jaguars have one of the highest bite strengths of any animal. When a cat chews bone, it grinds it into a paste. The only bones left with mountain lion attacks tend to be the flesh they couldn’t get out of the footwear.",

It was actual Tour guide Feliciano that came to their home spoke with Mirium the host family den mother if you will and told her the girls where 90minutes late for the tour they booked that day, so he says. He then got the keys to their rooms since they where on a separate section from her own home and went into there room with out Miriam to look around. He then waited most reports say about 4 hours to then notify the authorities who then notified the family. Miriam the host family originally was not concerned until Feliciano showed up. He also found Lisanns shoe and foot bones, along with Krises well preserved shorts. that she must have some how taken off while \"lost\" in the jungle. Because if she died or was dying while in the shorts even in let's say level ten rapids there still would have been stains and DNA left from the shorts sliding of the decomposing body. However since there was no DNA the investigators surmise they where take off prior to anything happening to her body hence the lack of any decomposition DNA staining blood discoloring etc.  But thank God their tour guide was so concerned and dedicated to involving himself on some random girls who no showed his tour and lucky break finding the broken foot with fractures miles away from the other remains this guy must be like a super hero... alerting everyone and finding all the missing evidence.  I am just saying where there is smoke...",

Thats why the last photo of Chris looking back saying \"hey are you sure we can get back in time your not getting us lost are you?\" as far as the bones the bacteria, leeches and various small worms and other things would have cleaned off the bones very fast especially considering alternate wet and dry and flash floods washing them down. Its panama people want to picture lions and ignore bacteria and such. I am avid hiker and even when finding bones in the desert infested with coyotes--even among coyote skulls NOT ONCE have a seen any bones with chew marks. But to clean off a skull or bones such as big horn sheep the only way to do it is leave it out or bury it in leaves and such and forget it for a month. The various bugs will for a fact even get into the tiny sinuses and passages and eat everything even tendons and disks between vertabrae which would make the bones more easily fall apart during the flash floods. lost people found eventually if in or near water OFTEN are missing their heads. another video the best--they even brought in expert retired life long finding people and bodies and he made it clear what he saw is EXACTLY how they are found. yet everyone visualizes lions and coyotes ripping them apart--never bacteria and other tiny flesh eating things since they insulate the public from it. The first distress and almost certain injury from their many falls HAPPENED FAST. Chris certainly was the first to finally succumb and BOTH certainly had various falls of all types. Back of chris head with flash was likely to try to inspect an injury-THEN it became desperate. why was photo deleted and bras tucked away they likely were wet and YES in desperation they likely huddled naked in the cold. perhaps delirious perhaps one of the desperation photos had nudity in it? who knows. shorts on the rock? perhaps not skinny dipping Chris could have been already dead and they were left as another marker. They simply got disoriented and possibly thought they were heading back towards the town. absolutely falling injuries--note they did not really travel that far.",

I mean these are smart girls so why didn’t they document their experience with the Hope their families would see it. Often if someone is lost in the wilderness and succumbing to the elements they try to leave a legacy of some sort to speak to their families. \n\nIf they fell off a cliff then the backpack would have gone over the edge with them into the water but it didn’t get wet apparently. And if it was at the top of the cliff it would have been exposed to all sorts of elements, rain, heat, dirt etc. But it was clean. \n\nThose are the sticking points for me that make an accident kind of not believable.",

    "text": "Late here..but There is a BIG mess with dates, times, phone logs that contradict some witness wich also contradict each other , and also some people confusing 31 and day one with this  these two trails (Pianista and Lino trail), there are a lot of theories and timelines. Phones data and photos maybe were tampered..some witness may lie or wrong...but NOT all witness lie or wrong..its imposible. So I go with this timeline , in wich witness saw them get out a taxi in the aftermoon at the start of Pianista or near that  (no with official dates that stay they started  pianista hike at 11am according to phonelogs).Also believe some witness mess with 31 and 1st....So my shoot is:\n\nMarch 31:  went to walk around Boquete and probably went to Av. Buenos Aires / casa Pedro just at the start of Pianista or Lino ( 1 km each other), they went just to the start of Pianista, with a taxi, bus? \n18 pm went to Si grid for massage with a wasap message. \n\n- april 1: Left school at 13pm\narrive with taxi at the start  with G.M around 13:40 pm...( some witness saw them )...started hike at around 14pm(still reception..)... then we have 508 ( around 16:30pm)..first stream photo ; (in presence with other people??), i think at this point they wanted return to Boquete...but something suddenly happened like an attack or something violent ,and strong believe  F son ( alive) and some of his gang- friends,Murg as, Os man,  Miran da..Leon ardo etc, ( all dead or missing same with Aguirre..and Adonis in prison) were in complot and carried them past the continental divide...that's the reason they never found them in that first two days\nÍ dont think photos were with photoshop..just rezise and messed with times.\n\nQuestions:\nMarch 31:went to Av buenos Aires...to Lino trail and come back at 15-30\" , Or Pianista trail ( officially no phone activity between 14pm -17pm). If they went why are no public pics of 31? Pics deleted ? Or dates altered?\n- Last wifi contact 16:44 in Spanish by the River?\n- Pedro saw them 31 or 1st?\n-on 1st taxi driver ( G.M, with two guys?) dropped them off around 13:40pm or really 10:30am?\n- 1st.wifi connection at 11 am on Pianista restaurant? Or 10:10 at Nelvis or Spanish school?\n- first call emergencys are from them?\nThat trail is full of people and sheds..how the hell nobody saw them? Or some locals saw something and wanted to be blind?\n-Why fincas in alto romero were not checked?\n-lifted at the start of Pianista by a car/truck and went swimming? \n-Or went swimming before start the trail? For me if it happens was at 31 , but who knows..they didn't say nothing on theirs diaries...but being honest ..i imagine KK not whanting register this thing for obvious reasons..personally i dont believed where them in that pic.\n-What about net providers? ( this can tell us were that day based on their phone locations)\n- kris Boyfriend call Kk at 14pm?  So how no more mobile reception at 13:38pm? They switch off their phones around 13:38 / 14pm?\n-Someone called them later on 1st and next days??\n- some pics on Pianista on 1st with photoshop? And out of order?\n-digital camera times and date altered?\n-what about german tourist on april 5th at Quetza trail claimed that that the girls had been beaten and thrown down a ravine? Or french tourist on 6th on Quetza trail who heard screams from two girls, then a loud crash and three guys on that trail?\n- if they were abducted and led to an abandoned cabin/shack.. how is the dogs didn't sense something?\n-are bones planted from them?\n-Why later troubles at Osman funeral ?\n-what really happened to Lee Zelteer,  he found the truth before die or killed? Readed that he saw in the deep web how they were beaten  ..but i dont believed it..\n\nOther options\n- they returned from Lino trail and both sat on the side of the road to go back to Boquete around  15pm and witness saw them turn a corner..why go to Pianista if they were tired and L sickly????\nGap here Oliva saw them walk at 16pm and Martina another witness saw them get into a car...another gap Lorenzo a guide saw them ascended the pianist...\nThere is few information about this...\n- or after 508 the ran afraid of some people and both fall and had an accident and captured them..i dont believe this thing about run in the jungle would let them send some message to the familes .\n- or they went to the start of Pianista twice and thats why mess with dates and witness timelines..so if they went morning why take photos again?\n-One priv investigator who went to Panama conclude they went to Tree Park and here worked and of H.G  friends and things went out of control and killed them\n- they went the same day twice to Pianista..\n- they went 31 afternoon to Pianista trail( sunny day).agressor changed  date on cameras (easy to do)...next day ( cloudy)went to another place probably near to avenida Buenos Aires and lifted by a car. \n\nFacts:\n-9 people died in strange circunstances involved in this case\n- investigation was a total disaster and closed quickly for protect tourism.\n- a lot of DNA and fingertips on their remains.\n-phone logs flawed\n-In all options foul play or third party involved, using the common sense imposible to survive more than ten days lost and not sent a single text( neither unsent) or a video.\n-3rd party was behind these phone calls.\n-F lied about meeting the girls and protected his son.\n-Bones planted\n- not all photos were shared to the public\nMy great gap is where was 508 pic..i have my doubt with official set that was like \" passing\" the continental divide..\n\nStrange actitudes and things:\nLanguage School and Aura\nI.L( who cancelled the volunteer work) and went later to Costa Rica\n- assistant hotel manager E.W who went to the speed of light to Germany\n-host family( M.G) ( spent 30 minutes in the girls room with F)\n\nJustice for KK & L!",

Kris was very intelligent I’m sure she could remember the pin or scratch it on the back with a rock etc",

Maybe because the bras being neatly folded in a backpack, the girls were planning a night swim at the Serpent River. Kris probably died first after falling off a falling zone.  Lisanne obviously tried to get help by calling 911 and took odd pictures to mark the locations where the scene happened. Lisanne probably died of either an infection from an animal, or dehydration. Or maybe when trying to seek help, she fell in the river, hit by large rocks in the waters and suffered injuries and being  swept away in the current and her body parts were torn by force. That’s my theory of the cause of deaths of Kris Kremers and Lisa Froon. RIP to these beautiful young girls.",

    "text": "No offence to the people of Panama, but the country isn't exactly famous for its great public safety and its best crime rate... \nNo doubt there was a 3rd or even 4th (5th...) person with them for a period of time.\nThe investigation must have been sluggish and ineffective because a) incompetence of the local forensic department; b) Panama is also known for its poverty, so tourism is something the nation can monetize from - no way they'd admit that 2 young women were abducted&murdered while being on a hike on one of Panama's most popular trails; c) a&b combined.\n\nThe backpack was found dry and in a perfect condition after so many days because someone placed it there after having kept it indoors during the first few days.\nNO WAY the girls just left the trail for fun and randomly \"fell off\" of the riverbank.\nTo that end, I cannot imagine myself as a young woman going on a hike with my girl friend in a foreign country where the crime rate is awfully high and gang activity is so common that even I am aware of it, thousands of kilometers away from Panama, in mid-Europe. It's common knowledge.\nI dont care how \"popular\" the trail with tourists - just NO. No hikes in secluded areas in such countries; or without two guys, appropriate amounts of supplies and a carefully planned  what-to-do scenario in case of emergency . Paranoid? Maybe. Oh, wait. Watch the video again and tell me i am \"paranoid\". 😶🙄\nPoor girls and their families. ❤🌹😢😢",

Knowing their time and being so intelligent talking themselves into a short cut or faster route- I’ve been there hiking it’s late/ your tired & hungry, outta water, it’s so tempting to cut out parts of the trail. It’s not fair to say they’re too smart to leave the trail. \nThe deleted photo could have been a shot of partial dressed or if they’re taking pics for orientation maybe they aimed it the wrong way and deleted so they wouldn’t become confused- lots of easy explanation.   \nIf one girl  slipped into the river canon I could see the other following to stay together. Also old tip if lost in the forest is to follow a river, so willing climb down into, it may even look easier then in a dense jungle- just seeing the sky would be uplifting. Those girls could’ve walked that river for 2 weeks or sat and waited for rescue becoming weaker by the day. If they drank the water, water born illness could have made them extremely dehydrated. Now roll an ankle or fall or hit your head. One girl dies along the way, surviving one would continue until she couldn’t. Broken bones can be explained by large predator animals or floating down the river until it gets stuck somewhere. Surviving girl probably sat her backpack somewhere safe and dry to protect the phones and camera. Wrong pins can be explained by dehydration or trying to remember her friends PIN\nThe murderer theory is juicy and tantalizing but no evidence thanks to a poorly run investigation. \nThe fact they tried emergency services that first day tells me they knew they were lost. A murderer isn’t gonna let them have their phones and call for help\nTragic all the way around. I’m so sorry for the girls and their family.",

Take almost 100 photos & not a single 1 of possible injuries. 2)They're 20 yr olds you cant tell me if they were physically able they wouldnt hve recorded at least a lil short video explainin what happened, they're final goodbyes, or heck even recorded a lil ea day like a documentary of what all they faced out there. Instead they just took some photos of the sky at night and 2 red bags that wouldn't tell any kind of story to their parents. Someone placed their things in backpacks and pretended to find it. I feel like it's not the 1st time that's happened in that area to a coup pretty girls from another country",

They arrived a week earlier than they were expected by the school (sabotage #1) therefore could not be accommodated to volunteer.  The girls were encouraged by the locals to not hike alone, and when offered a hike instructor they refused (sabatoge #2) The girls were already scheduled to go on a tour (hike) the very next day April 2nd, so why not just stick with the plan (sabotage #3). The only person to bring a backpack with even basic essentials was LisAnne, including the 1 bottle of water, Kris brought only her mobile phone, that’s it.  (Sabotage #4). The hike should have been 2 -3 hours total, but someone (obviously)decided to venture beyond the trail, onto another path deeper into the jungle, by now, I’ll let you figure it out. (Sabatoge #5)",

    "text": "Really this incident shocked me bad.. I saw some points were strong in it. I guess this mystery hides 'cannibal tribe' act behind. \n1. Bones: they were clean without flesh on it. No teeth bruise, scars on them. I can say it is bcos  the cannibal who skinned them and dismembered the body, had experience in butchering. (Nearly 50 gals and few men were disappeared b4) remember a clean butcher.\n2. Night photos: i suppose they werent taken by kris or lisanne. They were surely photographed by tribes bcos we can note the way they were taken. Some1 who doesn't know how to handle camera. Kris' hair image must have  been taken after the scalp peeling.\n3.backpack: after days it was found to us. Who will throw away a 83dollar.. A man eating people and living in caves/hideouts will definitely not need money. \nThen, kris' bones were found gathered in a place along with other men bones. This tells they dispose bones just like we throw trash in the can.\nAlso, lisa foot and fingers were found somewhere.. They were not fleshy We know. \nI found these when i glanced. If druglords or smugglers were involved, they would have not left bodies unburied or burnt.",

I think the last photos are them eating lunch, where lisanne looks disturbed. They were disturbed as they could sense something going on with the school, the guide F., and the taxi driver. They probably doubted the chance they were all involved in a conspiracy, despite what they could sense. Of course they have no idea how much their bodies are truly worth. They were in the crosshairs before they even got to Panama. They should have left when the school would not take them even though they planned months ahead. Its all so sad, I am sure they experienced a shockingly terrifying end. The dutch military should hVe went in",

If they were still alive the girls would have been in the photos, they would have left some sort of message, scrawled in the mud with a stick. Their bodies were dismembered by the killers and scattered. Their bag was placed by the killers so it would be found. The dog was shit scared, that is why it went home alone.
