    "text": "I think they went to swim or refresh themself at the 2nd or 3rd river after the continental divide (the river where the parents turn around). The river crosses the path. They probably departed the path and walked along the river, maybe they didn't go too far, but far enough to find a private place where to swim or just refresh themselves. This may be the reason why they removed the bras and put them in the bag. In my opinion the trouble started exactly there. No idea what, maybe an accident (but to both of them? that would be strange), or they were attacked. Probably when the search teams came they have been screaming to draw attention, but the river noise is very loud and could have completely covered their voices. I would have put up my bra again, especially at night, if it became chill. So two things are still mysterious to me: 1. why they did not wear they bra again and 2. why they BOTH could not move, as I would say that if only one was injured why the other one did not go back to the main path to search for help?",

BUT, PERSONALLY, I do believe that it was just an accident that the corrupt AND INCOMPETENT authorities managed SO BAD that in the end... the case just doesn't make sense. For example, I heard that one of the photos WAS in fact altered by authorities but it was an accident, they didn't save the original first and they brightened a photo to see better... altering the evidence. An in that way, they could have bleached the bone and then they were like \"shoot, forgot to take the picture first\". \n\nWe cannot believe in any evidence. \n\nSo, yeah, I think it was incompetence, corruption and (without a doubt) a sense of rush to close the case.",

It had to have been them dialing bc no way someone from panama knows the dutch emergency number.\n2.  If taken by someone, why would they allow them to be taking random pics several days later.\n3.  As far as pic 509....I use technology everyday and deal with glitches every day so i dont think you can take much from that.  Still an odd case and could go either way, but I would guess a bad fall was involved maybe slipping or trying to climb a rock or waterfall.",

    "text": "I truly believe that those pictures that were taken at night - especially, the one with the rock, red bag and a wood stick are not random at all! They were trying to leave clues behind! I googled symbols from different Native tribes  and it seems that a rock, a wood stick and something red (in this this case they only had the red bag, which is a very uncommon color for a plastic bag, but initially it could’ve been a white bag, but they soaked it in blood to make it red and they took the picture to convey a message, just like how they used to do in ancient times (and one of them would’ve had a strong knowledge of this).  I truly believe that something corrupt is going on and the volunteer opportunities is just a cover up. There are too many coincidence in this case. Just think….how convenient that the tour guide’s close friends/family members found the backpack, especially in the condition that it was found 🤨. Also , the reward that was given is nothing compared to the millions of dollars that they make selling organs and having two people that fit the profile of organ donors that are in high demand, they probably profited millions. In addition, considering that they only found certain body parts and the main organs or the bones were never found - that’s not just a random coincidence! This is a lucrative business for them and not only that,  it’s also something that they consider necessary to perform their rituals and sacrifices. I’m 100% certain that they were set up and should have seen the red flags the moment they got there 😔. I have a feeling that the unreleased pictures show evidence of one of them being deceased and that’s probably why they never released all the pictures (it has to be something really bad for them not to release all the pictures and by not releasing them , it tells you everything ). It’s just so heartbreaking that their lives were taken under such circumstances. I pray that the family receives justice 🙏 and I pray for the two beautiful souls that were taken from this world in such a senseless tragedy.",

But why have those not been made any better? Simply: They knew the real reasons of their deaths and it was an accident and they had to cover it. Think about it. \nManipulating the camera would have been easy, but manipulating the phones would not. It takes a highly paid expert to do this, so they omitted it. Also with the other belongings. Insted of wearing the backpack out, they took it right from the repository and also the foot because they kept him because he identifies one of the women. They took the bones right from the graveyard, where they still are, to misslead us here.\nBut where have the women been in those seven days. They have not felt distressed because  of the only few attempts to make contact. I also believe that elements of the dayfotos must have been taken during this time. In my opinion all camera-photos during this time had been erased. Equally messy because it had to be cheap and quick and executable by one or two loyal people.\nIs there a place where you can go with two women without they becoming suspicious for six or seven days? A place without mobilconnection but with locations worthy of two thumbs up? And if they would have to flee, because they want to work from the seventh or eight on, a location where they could have had an accident together at the same time or get lost? For me the phones indicates that they must have been alive. But where?",

Wtedy ani pieniądze z plecaka nie byłoby ukradzione, ciała byłyby w różnym stadium rozkładu (swoją drogą gdzie są czaszki), wtedy nie byłoby pisania, dzwonienia do rodziny, nagrywania wiadomości, a i nawet samo zdjęcie czystych włosów mogłoby być przedmiotem handlu. \nDziękuję za ciekawe przedstawienie sprawy.",

Things what I have learned are for example, if you go hiking, tell someone who you trust, where you are going and when you have planned to come back. Get knowledge what kind of conditions there is. Take clothes for rein and for cold. Map and compass, phone and so on. Think water and food and take more just for case. Pocket lamp and lighter or sticks for the fire. Some first aid equipment. Don´t be naive. You can meet people who look like nice but you don´t really know. And for the end. Keep yourself safe and don´t go over your limits. If you do even those things what I wrote, you can enjoy nature with peace. Rip Kris and Lisanne.",

Unfortunately, they checked every box for people that are looking to sell human organs on the black market (and they were young, vulnerable women). There's a lot of money to be made from selling human organs (from what I hear). It just never made sense to me about the bleached bones and some of the conditions that the remains were found in.  That's really the only thing I can think of that makes some sort of sense.  The bookbag was weird and seemed like a set up. Two bras, two pairs of sunglasses, and so on. So weird.  Who packs 2 bras for a hike? And what about the phone calls and all of the times that \"someone \" tried unlocking the phone(s)..? Don't get me started on the deleted photo. The photo that could have only been deleted in a very specific way. It was all too weird & it seemed like the government was trying to protect someone, or at the very least, they wanted tourism to continue.  🤔",

    "text": "This is the first I've heard of the 3 additional individuals mixed in amongst the remains. The remains being so completely disparate in decomp level without indications of predation is almost a guarantee that humans were involved. I've considered tribes in the past but it would surprise me with the amount of pressure that panama authorities wouldn't be familiar with tribes in the areas to address it quickly. Also it seems like there were more direct reasons for panama authorities to ignore and obfuscate findings than to protect tribes. I'm not familiar with the tribal relations in panama specifically but they're scapegoated so often in other countries that it seems like they would have been an easy out if authorities thought they could get the story to stick. Meanwhile all kinds of things were mishandled and there's a complete lack of transparency even though they claim it's been solved. My top theory is that panama authorities actually did have a chance to rescue the girls and in the process either caused their deaths or some other mishap that they would have been unable to account for on a world stage. That metatarsal injury for instance, if you've ever seen a cartoon where someone is being pulled while running and gets their foot caught on a root, that's the kind of mechanism that produces that type  injury. If they were attempting to rescue the girls and attempt left them with injuries that the world stage may misinterpret, it would likely have seemed easier to have thier things randomly appear after you've kept them safe for a time and let the jungle handle the rest for you. Once they reemerge you can account for everything via natural processes. Ish",

You will have a lot of hassle otherwise because your phone will be unusable 😅",
