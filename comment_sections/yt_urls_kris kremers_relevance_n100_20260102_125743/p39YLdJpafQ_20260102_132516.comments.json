I am from Panama and through the years the situation with crime, drugs and gangs has become a true nightmare with abductions and all sorts of crimes, the only predatorial animal in these areas would be jaguar but they never seek out any kind of contact with humans as tigers or other big cats, they walk the other way and you'd be blessed to have a peek at one scurrying by. I would not doubt that these girls ended up crossing paths with people capable of something so horrible. Under the cover of the jungle and feared by locals so many crimes can be done.

    "text": "This case still haunts me. \n\nNot only was the backpack found far from where they were last seen, but it was completely on the other side of the watershed that runs between Chiriqui province and Bocas del Torro Province. \nThe girls would have had to have hiked up one of three river valleys, the Pianista River valley, the Paloma River valley or perhaps the Palo Alto river valley. These are the most logical ways for them to have hiked, as the trail from where they left follows the el Pianista for a short while. Whichever way they went they would have had to climb up to about 1800m at least if not 2000m to cross the watershed and enter the other drainage. \n\nThe Culebra river is NOT JUST 15 km from where the women were last seen! \nIt is over 35 km away AS THE CROW FLIES!!! \nAlso, this guy means the Chianguinola RIVER not the Chianguinola PROVINCE! Chianguinola Province is all the way over on the EAST COAST! Chianguinola Province is over 70km from where the girls were. \n\nIn order to get to the Culebra River the girls would have had to hike up El Pianista, climb 1800-2000m cross the watershed and enter Bocas del Torro Province. From there if they went downhill they would have entered into the Chianguinola river drainage first. Most likely around the middle fork of the Chianguinola river. From there they would have had to hike down the Chianguinola river. The Culebre river empties into the Chianguinola river near Punta Blanca and La Mina where the two rivers form a lake. That is an insane distance from where the girls were last seen. It is at least 35 if not 40 km!!!! \n\n\nAlso, where the bags were found was UPRIVER on the Culebre, so the girls would have had to go up the Pianista river, cross the watershed at 1800m to 2000m of elevation, go down into the Chianguinola river drainage. They would then have had to follow this river for like 40 km and finally they would have had to GO UP THE CULEBRA RIVER in order to get to the small village near where the packs were found. There were hundreds of fingerprints on their backpacks and belongings.\n\nAccident theory:\nOn one hand, it is very easy for someone to slip, have a fall and hurt themselves, but there were two of them. The girls were obviously not planning on hiking, but they still could have survived a very long time without food there, and being in a river drainage, they would have had plenty of access to water. The temperatures in that area in April are on average between 25°C and 15°C. Higher up they temperatures would have been a little cooler. The girls certainly would not have died of the heat up there in April. \n\nIronically, it would have been quite possible for them to get hypothermia at night especially if they were wet. It is almost always wet in that area. Did they have anything with them to make a fire with?  I do not know what the girls' hiking or orienteering skills were like, or if they really knew where they were going, when they set out. It does not seem like they planned to hike for days. It looks more like the planned to go the 750 or so meters up the La Pianista trail to the summit, make some photos and return. \n\nDid they get turned around and go into the Chianguinola river drainage thinking it was the Pianista river? That is possible, but they would have certainly realized that at some point. If not by dark om the first day, then certainly by noon the next day. I find it highly unlikely that they would travel 40 km down the Chianguinola river, passing the rather large Rio Playita entering the Chianguinola from the left (West) and even passing the river Estrelita also entering from the left or West only to turn up the Culebre after what would have taken them at least 2-5 days and over 40km of hiking. It just does not make sense. Unless they did not know what they were doing got lost and panicked? If they had any sense at all and had been camping or hiking at all before then I just do not see this happening. \n\nAs far as I can recall the weather was nice for a few days and then it did rain. Perhaps they got turned around and were lost headed down the Chianguinola thinking it was the Pianista for awhile and then got caught in a flash flood? Their bones from what I understand, were found strewn all over. Most of them were in the riverbed, but some where higher up. If I recall correctly the bones were found years after the girls disappeared. One was a boot with the girl's foot still in it, but there was no signs of severing or broken bones and the investigators believe that the limb became separated after severe decomposition. Drowning would explain why most of the bones were found in the river drainage. The bones found higher up on the banks could have been carried there by scavenging animals. \n\nApart from that, there are venomous snakes and jaguars, but those scenarios are pretty unlikely. I suppose it could have been possible for one of them to have gotten hurt and then have been predated by jaguars, but this theory is very implausible. The most likely scenario here is that one of the girls got hurt and the other girl went for help and got lost or hurt herself. \n\nFoul Play:\nFoul play seems to be the most likely theory to me. Their packs were found 40 km away from La Pianista as the crow flies that is up one river over a continental divide of 2000m, then 35-40 km down another river and then up another river for like another 2-3 km. It seems unlikely that a gang would take them to the city and go clubbing with them only to come back out into the jungle and dispose of the bodies in such a remote area. There is no vehicle access out there. No. More likely they ran into someone or went with someone. Someone, whom they knew. Maybe someone, who was going to \"show them the area\". He got them out there alone and he murdered them. It could have been up to several people. If they partied perhaps they wanted to party in the jungle. This seems far more plausible to me. \n\n\nAs much as I know how easy it is for people to die of exposure. I cannot imagine that it what happened to them. That area is remote, but it is not like no one walks along those trails. There are huts, sheds, remote homesteads along the Rio Chianguinola on both sides. A few of them are probably visible from the river. If the houses had any kind of lighting, they would have been very visible at night.",

    "text": "On every true crime video, it seems there's someone who comments how out of the many, many true crime cases they've watched, THAT one is the that sticks with them the most. This is that case for me--well, tied with the whole Turtle Island Thailand gang-corruption-coverup murders haha. \n\nAny theory on this case (or derivative) get be picked apart so it's frustrating. Some things start to make sense in your mind, it's all clicking together, and then you go \"but wait, what about the ___ \" So yeah the only thing i'm certain of is that i'm not certain. I do notice however, that people who support the theory that they just got lost (whether coupled with an animal attack, a fall of a cliff, effects of dehydration etc.) don't seem able or willing to refute arguments for the (a) foul play theory. \n\nEven to believe they were kidnapped by a gang would open up so many more questions that have left people scratching their heads. But I tend to lean towards some form of the foul play theory, and here why.\n\nPoints that contradict the theory that they just got lost:\n\n1) the backpack -- it was found 70 days after the girls' disappearance, beside a river bank 15 km away from the pianista trail. The lady who found it said she was at the same spot the day before but didn't see any backpack there. The backpack was NOT wet -- it was in pristine condition and the items inside were dry and appeared untouched. The phones and digital camera were in there, so it becomes difficult to see how the girls could've been the ones taking the pictures and calling emergency services in the jungle for 11 days, and yet the backpack doesn't get wet or dirty, and somehow makes a long journey on its own without getting wet. \n\n2) Lisanne's severed left foot was found in her hiking boot, and the cut was clean -- This disproves any animal attack theory and shows a human being cut off her foot. Unless Pokemon are real and a Scyther jumped out and cut her foot off, then it was a human. It can't be argued that an animal could have done that, plus the boot was clean and still tied to her foot, with no sign of scratches or claw marks\n\nHonestly, I don't see how anyone can believe they just got lost given the above 2 points. Ok let's tack on some more for goal differential :P\n\n3) Pictures -- I'm hoping people have watched/read other things about this case, to gather more details. The daytime pictures and nighttime pictures tell completely different (albeit incomplete) stories. \n\nTimeline: they start their hike on April 1st. Yikes, I didn't even notice that was April Fool's, ugh. \n\n-> daytime pictures - The girls are smiling. These are the ones at the foot of the trail, along it and leading up to them reaching the peak where I wish they had been able to turn back. In the strange pictures of Kris beside the stream of water and crouched by the bushes, she's not smiling at all and some believe at this point they were either kidnapped or had run into another group and knew they were dangerous.\n\n These initial pictures were taken before 1:30-2:00pm, so that refutes the taxi driver saying he dropped them off at that time. Nope, he might've just misremembered but this notion that they started their hike at 2pm is simply false. MORE on that taxi driver in a bit ....\n\n> nighttime pictures - After 2pm on April 1st, no one used the camera for 7 days. It just doesn't make sense, if they were alone and simply lost, to not have a SINGLE picture of them, or anything in the daytime for that matter. But then on April 8th, someone took more than 90 photos in less than 3 hours - those hours were between 1am-4am. This is where the \"they just got lost\" camp suggests that these photos were meant to light up the area so they could see their surroundings, perhaps signal an airplane or search party, or perhaps scare off an animal they (or rather just she, by this point) might have heard. I have to admit, whyy would kidnappers be out at 1-4am taking pictures though? Best chance to not be seen as they make it look like the girls took the pictures in the jungle? Oh, I dunno. But then again, WHY was there 0 camera activity for 7 days?\n\nThen there's the deleted photo and this one's a mammoth. Keep in mind that pictures were taken on a digital camera, not their phones. A computer must be used to fully erase a photo, and the Canon company itself confirmed this. It makes a strong argument that the girls managed to get a picture of something or someone incriminating, and whoever kidnapped them (* cough Feliciano Gonzales) had to have deleted the picture. \n\n4) Phones -- alright so on the first day, April 1st, the first emergency call to 112 was placed just after 4:30pm. Then a call was placed to 911 but didn't get through. Then phones turned off for 14 hours. Again, why? If they were lost and had their phones, how do they both go 14 hours without having their phone on? \n\nIn total, they made about 80 calls. On day 5 (April 5th) LIsanne's phone died. Kris's phone stayed on until day 11 but between April 7th-10th Kris's phone was off/had no activity. It was turned on again, for the last time, at 10:51am on April 11th. It was turned off exactly an hour later at 11:51am, and this was the end of any phone activity. \n\nOn April 6th, there were several attempts to enter an incorrect code. There were dozens of attempts up until April 11th. The girls obviously would have exchanged pass codes so it's very unlikely that Lisanne would've been locked out of Kris's phone. Plus, they didn't need a pass code to make an emergency call so investigators concluded it was unlikely to have been Lisanne trying to enter the code. The girls hadn't called home or the place they were staying, or anything other than emergency services in those 11 days so that seemed a bit strange. Why \"dozens\" of attempts to enter a phone, unless it was kidnappers looking for photos or something before they plant the phones in the backpack and leave them by the river. \n\n5) Tour guide / gang members \nOh I gotta wrap this up. No one's reading anyway but I can't sleep so let's write until the eyes get heavy haha. Okay but yeah, let's go over some of these characters.\n\nFeliciano Gonzales - the tour guide\nInternet sleuths like me believe he's our guy. He basically IS a red flag, everything that he does. The girls were supposed to meet with Feliciano but they didn't. So after the girls went missing, he went over to the place they were staying and was in the girls' room for 30 minutes. There wasn't a door key in the backpack that was found, which doesn't make sense. Then of course it's Feliciano who spotted the boot with Lisanne's severed foot in it, and other bones. 33 bones were discovered, one pair of jean shorts, and one shoe from each of the girls. Then there was a rolled up ball of human skin. Then you look at Feliciano's tripadvisor reviews online and the one where he threatens a woman with a machete sticks out. Machete, clean cut above the ankle, hmm. OH, and then the suspicious deaths. Over 10 people connected to the case have died, including 4 member of the Los gang. The one gang member who survived? Henri Elizas Gonzales, Feliciano's son. Alright. \n\nTaxi driver -- named Leonardo Gonzales -- drove the girls to la pianista, told police he saw a pickup truck near where he dropped the girls off. He was found dead in a river, 7 months after the girls' disappearance.\n\nGang member 1 - Osman Velezuales (23 years old) - died April 4th (3 days after the girls' disappearance). \n\n2 - Juan Rivera Miranda (24)\n3 - Jorge Murgas (23)\n4 - Adonis Henriberto (23)\n\nOne was drowned in a shallow pool, one hit and run, and I forget the other. I'm tired, still need to look up another supposed suspect named Plineo Montenegro. \n\nBut yeah, again no one will have read this but forgive the long rant, anyway. This case just has so many strange elements to it. I mean, the girls actually had a compass, a solar power bank, and a knife in their room. They obviously would've taken these if they planned to go on a long hike, which further makes me believe they were intercepted at some point on the trail. \n\nIt just seems obvious that there was foul play involved. Foul play's a euphemism for what Lisanne and Kris went through, and I can't see any way they just got lost. Again they didn't pack much, they didn't take any daytime photos after the first 2 hours of their hike, the condition of the bone fragments, the knowledge of gang/police/government corruption in Panama, all of it. If they were lost, wouldn't they have tried to mark where they've been? It's dense jungle but even little pieces of clothing tied to a tree could be seen by people searching. What about trying to make SOS signs out of rocks or sticks?> Or at least make piles of random sticks and brush so you'll know you've been there before, and people searching can tell a human made those piles. \n\nI dunno, it just seems a bit disrespectful to the girls and their lives to believe they were foolish and got lost. Just think, if Lisanne or Kris was your daughter, would you be able to look at this case and accept that the girls must've just got lost? Evidence for them being lost pales in comparison to them being kidnapped, does it not?\n\nThen again, I could be wrong :)",

    "text": "I live in Ecuador. As here in Ecuador, Panama has an early sunset. This is something people from North of the equator don't think about.  The sun sets at 6:30 every day of the year. Little different in Panama. But similar.  With cloud cover and in a wooded area it is pitch black by 6:45. I've been lost in the woods at night before and could only rely on the sound of a stream going downhill to know where I was going. I would guess accident caused by a situational awareness breakdown. Just like being blind in a snowstorm, a pitch black jungle sounds and looks the same no matter the direction you travel.",

Due to the area depending heavily on tourism, they have plenty of motivation to cover things up. (and total aside, but the fact that the host families didn't immediately alert the police is insane to me...both they and whatever company arranged the host families should face charges there)",

    "text": "I've hiked the Pianista Trail last year. Foul play a 100% \n\nWhy?\nYou can't get lost there, like everyone who says the girls got lost, please do the trail and show me how you get lost there. There is cattle fences almost all the time next to you in that \"jungle\" and a river next to you that runs into town. I'm not a good hiker and my sense of direction is pretty bad, but if you dropped me there blindfolded I'd find my way back.\n\nYes, it's a bit muddy but not too bad. At the beginning the offline map is about 50 meters off so occasionally you follow a wrong path but realize quickly you are on private property or a cattle fence blocks the way and you turn around.\n\nEveryone hikes in shorts and shirt btw because it's very warm and humid and the trail is easily accessible. The trail takes about 3 hours round trip tops and 70% is covered with cow shit. So yes green jungle vegetation left and right but remote? Dense? Hostile? No. You of course don't need a guide for finding your way. But people use guides for bird watching and finding monkey's and sloths. \n\nAnyway....\n\nI have been traveling around the world over several months for the last 10 years. Alone and now with my boyfriend. So I think I have a pretty good idea what I'm talking about. It's completely different how you as a woman are perceived when alone or with other girls compared as to when traveling with a male companion. I have many stories to tell from my travels in the means of danger and safety and girls like Kris and Lisanne were aware and not stupid. So I'm sure they would not venture off the trail without good reason and they surely would want to avoid the extra \"attention\" you get as a female. I'm super careful myself, always. And I think it's common knowledge, not everywhere in the world a human life is valued the same. We even had a local here straight out telling us: \"It's easy to get away with murder in Panama. Nobody cares enough.\" And she shrugged it off casually while talking about the loose laws in general and how in completely other regards (keeping wild animals as pets) benefited her goals in this country. It was a surreal conversation. \n\nBoquete itself is pretty safe I'd say. Great town. Most of the trails (for example \"the lost waterfalls\" or \"pipeline trail\") around town are on private property, so you pay to do it and register. You only meet other travelers there. Pianista is different. It's a trail also used by locals because there is farmland around it and people live there. And the trail technically goes further all the way to the bocas along villages. You can meet anyone there if you are walking long enough and far enough but you don't by mistake go missing. It's simply not that wild out there. So when I at the end of our hike asked my boyfriend: \" So what do you say, did these girls get lost?\" He just snorted. And I agree. I think they met someone they shouldn't have.",

Even if they did not document their bad situation with the camera , by recording a statement to let people know what happened for example(which would seem like something you do) , there would be more phone records of them trying to reach the outside world other than calling 112. I would guess their killer(s) took the phones and camera, asked for the codes, and called 112 themselves and took the pictures to make it seem like they got lost. The picture of the head is done in a way that it could have been taken by one of the girls, but i very much doubt that it was.",

Then they were picked up by a red truck ( no taxi available) and drove in the direction of the Caldera.  2+1=3 hours. \n\nThese Dutch girls were either abducted or murdered inside a village house in the area.

Even the authorities said early on that it was foul play. But they quickly retracted their story soon after for fear of losing out on tourism and/or having to go against some locals which they didn't want to deal with. It seems to be a corrupt place, where they're dealing with issues in a peculiar way. \n\nIt was such a mistake for the girls to travel to Panama, just the two of them on their own. They could have gone with an arranged group-tour not to be subjected to unpleasant surprises or having to lose their lives. \n\nR.I.P.",

They were both young and strong - one was a volleyball player but both hiked this trail in very good time according to the time stamps on their pictures so they were clearly sure footed and fit. So very doubtful both would befall an accidental drowning or fall in my opinion. The temps were warm and plenty of water and insect life so they would survive many weeks if lost, and presumably both intelligent with university degrees so would not wander too far off once they realized they were lost. Finally, if they had been injured and those pictures were used to ward off animals etc and they were conserving battery - I still think that when they were beginning to lose hope - they would have used their remaining battery to record a message or text for their families saying what happened and goodbye. They were both very close to their families. There is no way they would run out their batteries taking pictures of hair and garbage and trees and not leave a message for their parents. All the evidence was staged to look accidental in my opinion.",

I've seen deep storied of this like wrong passwords being entered on a phone and the random photos in the darkness, which I think after one died the other could have been trying to get into her phone and used a camera flash to get around in the dark. BUT... in saying that, the lack of bones found or clothes ect there was something fishy that happened. If they just died somewhere, their whole skeletons would be laying there and the clothes they were wearing at the time. This is what makes it such a mystery....",

(They both had extensive search histories concerning the location of said waterfalls in the week leading up to their disappearance, but assured those who warned them not to look for them that they wouldn't... but they did end up with around two extra hours they weren't expecting to have by reaching the summit early...) The gullies they photographed themselves in were not all along their original path and have since been identified. As has the dirt trail they were on a week later. What most likely happened was that they realized they weren't going to be able ro make it back to the summit (and thus the only path back to town) before it got dark  and were going to have to spend the night on the mountain. In that gully area, the only cleared ground suitable for setting up any sort of makeshift camp would be one of the gullies themselves. They made their first attempts to contact help around an hour before dark which makes sense. The temperature was in the mid to upper 50's at night, and they were in shorts and tee shirts, so they would have wanted shelter. The debris formations they took pictures of themselves in front of would have seemed ideal for that. Such gullies are dangerous (especially before the rainy season is fully under way) since blockages can form and hold back water, leading to a very strong surge with debris down the mountain when the blockage gives. It likely rained that night, and they got hit by such a surge with nowhere to go inside the debris tunnel they were in. I've seen such surges, and they would definitely have been injured to some degree and washed along for a bit. Had one or both been carried to where the incline steepened, it would have led to significant injuries and no viable way back up.\n\nThey would have had to travel down the gully, which would have taken them to the river. There, they would have had water, but nowhere to really go (especially if one or more were injured) and would likely have decided to wait and hope a boat would go by (highly unlikely), or searchers would find them. You can go quite a while without food, but after about a week, you'd be pretty desperate. The dirt path they were on in their week later photos has since been identified via drone, and when you see it, things start to make sense. It ran along a gully and from the bottom likely looked like it went all the way up. It didn't. About halfway up, it essentially ran into a wall of dense foliage with nowhere to go. That would have been the last of their energy and the point at which at least one was likely to more or less give up. They probably went back down the mountain to their water source to wait for help, one died, and the other was too weak to make it for much longer. The only way back up would have been a gully, and by then, there was likely a good bit of water flowing down, so the survivor would have had no options. Nature took care of things from there.\n\nThe concerned looks on their faces in some of the gully photos were likely the result of their realizing they weren't going to get back in time but might as well take the pictures since that's what got them into the mess in the first place. While the night photos were likely just them using the flash as a flashlight. The head photo makes sense if you have an injured half starved person going up an incline with the person behind them taking periodic pictures to see where they were going. A stumble and fall would bring the person behind down as well, and a photo could easily have been snapped in the process. The photos aimed upwards were probably an attempt to signal a drug plane heard but not seen (as they run without lights) which regularly fly over that area at night. (Somewhere down there, there's probably such a pilot who saw those flashes but can't say anything about it because then they would have to explain why they were flying over that area at night with no flight plan registered anywhere.)\n\nThe physical evidence all makes sense as remains and items will get washed into the river during the rainy season. Also, the people in the village were not informed of the missing hikers until quite a while afterward and their stories as to where the evidence was found and it's initial condition were different depending on which villager was asked. They had probably already found the stuff, cleaned it, and were using some of it when they found out, and just threw it all back together to turn it in. The phones and camera were damaged and not in working condition with quite a bit of garbled data on them. The investigators were simply able to retrieve some of the data from them. The oddities of missing photos etc. could easily be explained by that. The \"famous\" missing photo had a registry entry but no trace of the actual image file. That can happen from a glitch. The investigators merely said that the only way it could have manually been removed was via PC, not that it had been removed so. Anyone smart enough to remove the image file would have purged the registry entry as well and attempted to adjust the numbering to completely cover it... or just destroyed the camera (and phones) to make sure there was no evidence to begin with. The foot in the shoe is perfectly natural when it comes to human remains. Shoes slow the decomp process down which leads to the feet eventually falling off. Shoes are somewhat buoyant, so if they end up in the water, they'll travel along. The \"sun bleached\" bones were most likely not truly or fully sun bleached. A couple of species of the last stage decomp beetles in the area excrete phosphates as they do their work. Such phosphates easily and quickly leech into the bone and turn it very white (they even have a slight glow in the dark for a bit after prolonged exposure to sunlight.)\n\nI think that covers most of the \"mystery.\"",

I don’t think the women would abandon the dog that was graciously lended to them by their tourist family under the circumstances of “partying” in the jungle with the gangsters.\n\nMoreover, if the two women did somehow manage to escape the gangsters trying to murder them I doubt they would make it far enough to take those night pictures in hot pursuit because the local gangsters knew the trail way better than the women did.\n\nI believe that the night pictures prove the women became hopelessly lost after they both slipped and fell from the “monkey bridge” or from another steep incline on the trail causing the dog Azul to panic and instinctually run back home without them.\n\nThe night pictures are the most disturbing evidence because I believe one of the women was trying to use the light from the camera flash to hopelessly navigate through the pitch black jungle.\n\nAs the days went on, the women became more and more lost while being in close proximity of the trail and were ultimately hunted down and eaten by a wild predator.\n\nKeep in mind that most of the time hikers who get lost are usually within a few miles of rescue but panic and anxiety cause logic and reason to become forgotten.\n\nJust a theory for thought is all.",

One of the worst things investigators did was not investigate the people taken in the photos with them in the beginning. One of the girls was wearing a bold white and red striped tank. That should've helped determine if those were the girls in the photo with the other people. Nevertheless, they should've been questioned, the owners of the restaurant should've been questioned (especially since they let their dog go with the girls after allegedly warning the girls not to go). That whole thing seems weird to me. Why warn these girls and not everyone? Why would the girls go so deep into the trail when they had the presence of mind to hire a guide the next day. This is a case for the FBI or highly trained international team, as local authorities don't seem to be willing to do the hard investigations.",

    "text": "I have researched this intensely some 4 years ago, and I think I've got it figured out. Not the question, who exactly was the main culprit, but it's fairly clear they were abducted and kept as prisoners, and gangr*ped over a long time. \nAs I speak Spanish, I could search local social media, and found quite a few off-the-record remarks and insider jokes, about \"keeping gringos in the basement\" and \"being an abductor\" or \"girl killer\". This area is narcos territory, and the local youth are heavily implicated with gang activity. Some of them had a beef with another group, and that's when they started hinting at what these guys were trying to hide. The locals probably all know who did it, but don't say a word, because there have already been a few suspicious deaths of people \"who knew too much\".\nThe girls managed to flee, but fell down a ravine, this is when the last photos were taken. Kris died of her injuries, and Lisanne was taken back to the dungeon.\nWhen the parents arrived and search parties started to comb the area, the narcos got nervous and wanted the police and the reporters out of the area, which is riddled with hidden cocaine kitchens. \nThat's when Lisanne was killed, too. Carefully selected remains of the girls were strategically placed, so that they could be found. A corrupt state prosecutor who was in the pockets of the narcos quickly concluded that they had gotten lost and fell victims to an accident. Case closed, now everybody go home, please.\nThere are a lot of people who know the truth, and a lot of them should be behind bars. But the truth will never come out as long as drug lords rule over the area.",

Which means that they made it back to Boquette. The lost in the jungle story is false. Another way to see this is that 2 days after their disappearance some 45 searchers and one helicoptor looked for them and found nothing. Yet 10 weeks later the backpack, Kris's shorts and an assortment of body pieces was found. Clearly the evidence was planted.\n   To be really grim the girls were lured to Panama, by the school director under false pretenses, the main aim being the sex-trafficking trade. That didn't work out, but there was some rich local creep that needed a lung transplant. That would explain Kris's bleached pelvic bone,  as a corrupt hospital would have no trouble in cracking her ribs open and removing flesh in a vat of caustic soda.\n    The average cost of a lung transplant in USA is $250,000, so its hardly surprising that lesser members of the gang, whose loyalty might waver were systematically murdered.\n    \n    The above comment is based on testimony from a gang members girlfriend, who understandably fled to Costa Rica for sanctuary.\n\n    Margarita's comments in interview, regarding an immediate murder by a gang member being refused sex is almost certainly false, as an attempt to divert attention away from organised crime.",

    "text": "Didn't know about possible gang involvement until this video. But it matches with my previous theory on this case: \n\n\"There's 2 killers [or a gang] working as a team. The girls snap a photo of their killers just prior to their abduction, the missing image, 509. The killers over the next few days do what they're gonna do with the girls and their remains. Then on April 8th, one of the killers, killer 1, starts looking through the camera pics. He notices there's incriminating evidence in pic 509. He hastily deletes it. Killer 2 advises him that deleting the pic doesn't actually delete it; it has to be written over. So killer 1 proceeds to take 99 random photos in the middle of the night in an attempt to [overwrite] deleted pic 509. Killer 2 [or 3 if gang-related] then explains that there's no guarantee he overwrote the entire file, and that it may still be [at least partially] recoverable. Now, for whatever reason, they have already planned to plant the backpack with the phones and camera, etc. [to make it look accidental, possible police cover-up], and really don't want to just smash the camera or its memory card. So instead, they remove the memory card, insert a new one and format it. Then using a computer they copy the contents of the old card onto the new one. The computer won't copy deleted data, thus pic 509 is missing for good [there was no trace of pic 509 ever existing, and per Canon, it is impossible for the camera to randomly skip a photo in sequence].\"",

Either they got turned around and lost (which easily happens in the forest) or one or both of them got hurt in a fall or other accident. They tried to call for help but had no phone coverage. (April 1 around 4:40 PM). They probably decided to spend the night at some point and try again in the morning. They tried again periodically through April 4 when one phone died.  They possibly moved at one or more points ending up in the Culubre River basin. (Which would have provided a water source, but was not the area being searched). By April 8th when the photos were taken one could have been dead (or sick/hurt) and the other out of her mind in a panic. She was possibly trying to signal some noise she heard etc. At least one of them survived until April 11.",

As someone who's father was a probation officer, self defense instructor and karate instructor for over 20 years I just can't even with the amount of young women who think they are invincible and trek out into areas that are dangerous. Homework, ladies, homework. And if you think the area might even kind of be dangerous, you and a friend together is not enough to stave off the danger that lurks in areas unknown.

    "text": "This video is a good introduction to the case but leaves many, many details out. It was foul play. That's the only explanation for countless inconsistencies with the circumstances and physical evidence in this case, including but not limited to: the backpack, a roll of human skin, the location and condition of bones, the phone & camera data, a shoe, and local knowledge of this trail being easy and safe to travel on.  Please do more in depth research before claiming an accident to be likely in this case. It's not. In fact, many mental gymnastics are necessary to make the evidence consistent with an accident, and it still leaves a ton unexplained or in conflict. In my humble opinion, it is nigh impossible for this case to not involve human intervention and foul play based on all of the details available.",

    "text": "A couple of errors in this video. It was Kris who had a boyfriend, not LIsanne. The time stamp of 14.00 to start with the Pianista Trail must be false. It's just not logical. It takes 3 hrs to reach the summit, so they wouldn't be back before dark (around 18.30 hrs). Kris and Lisanne were not dumb teens, especially Lisanne had planned everything carefully. She looked the trail up on the computer in the B & B where they stayed. Third, knowing the gang members from previous partying seems unlikely. Kris and Lisanne went to Bocas del Toro before they came to Boquete. That's another area. However, it is possible they met Osman on the morning of April 1. Another thing is dog Blue. If you think the pictures on the Pianista Trail are real, you would expect at least one photo of Blue. I think the husky didn't join them on the trip. The owner of El Pianista Restaurant didn't get his facts straight.\n\nMy take on this case, on which I read a lot in the last 9 years, is almost the same as the mother of Osman told  the journalist in november last year. Kris and Lisanne went up there, but at 10.30 hrs in the morning. The taxi driver that brought them, was also found dead a year or so later.  They reached the summit at 13.00 - 13.30 hrs, walked for another hour or so and then turned around. Since they saw the place already, they didn't take pictures anymore. Until photo 509, which was deleted by computer. I think one of the gang members, or all of them, was on there. They met Kris and Lisanne propably an hour from the entrance of the trail, wanted to party, but Kris and Lisanne declined and called 911 (112 in The Netherlands). Later they were forced in a car, murdered and the killers made a setup with fake calls, fake night photo's. They probably covered the remains with lime, only to scatter them on the trail months later.",

That doesn’t seem likely. If they took them from the woods to a party and killed them, it seems more likely that they would discard their bodies around the town or a completely different area, not simply take them back to the trail. I definitely think one of them got hurt, probably Kris because it’s her bloody hair in one of those photos they took, and the other girl didn’t want to leave her alone and they lost their bearings out in unfamiliar woods and eventually succumbed to the elements.",

    "text": "Here is what I have concluded based on the known evidence and my own investigation of this tragic matter.\n\n1. That area has wildlife and woods but it's not the amazon folks. There are farms  nearby that path, pasture,  etc. They did not get lost.  \n2. I reject the idea that the two were eaten or killed by wild animals even though Panama does have jaguars. I base this conclusion on the fact that the dog on loan to them returned to its original owner . Any predator animal would have killed the dog defending them , first.  \n3. There are Fincas in the area. Based on the night photos, I do believe the women were being stalked.  Perhaps they thought if thry took photos in the direction of the sounds made by the person or persons following them, he would flee . \nIt is possible there existed a photo of the murderer (s) which was deleted  by the culprits.\n4. The persons of interest should be, in no particular order,  the jilted Guide, someone who lives on or owns one of the nearby Finca houses  who might have encountered them and invited them over gorgeous a meal or guarroom or lemon ade.\n5. I do not believe the photo of the head of  blond hair belongs to either woman. It might not be that of a woman. Why take such a photo? \n6. Given the placement of the various body  parts  and the fact money  ( some of it) was found along with the cell phones and camera and other items , I believe these were \" arranged \". \n7. At some weeks after their death,  the animals did eventually come to the various locations to eat them as the foot found in one boot may indicate. \n8. This was made to look like the two got lost by the culprits who fid them in. \n9.  Notice, I say culprits,  plural, but it was only 1 man if the killer had both at gunpoint . \n10. A man or a small group of 2 -3 men may have been rejected by the 2 women whereupon they were murdered.  This was not a simple\n robbery unless it had gone terribly wrong. \n11.The police should visit every Finca and work hand in the area . They may have been invited to get a bite to eat only to discover once inside that they were going to be robbed or sexualay assaulted or sadistically killed. \nNot an accident.  Not lost and starved to death. Not attacked by wild animals. They either met up with a Panamanian they recognized from a prior encounter who stalked them or ...someone along the famous path how lived nearby murdered them in cold blood and then took great pains to make it look like  it was not a robbery,  not a sexual assault, and/ or  not a murder. \n\nThe dog returned .There has to be a reason why she took a photo  picture of a person with blond hair. \n\nHope this helps your investigation.",

Then there's the suspicious behavior of the dude that was supposed to be their guide the next day. I realize it's a \"mini\" documentary but to omit those things is slipshod. How can anyone believe that, after such a long search, the backpack and only fragmentary human remains would be found? If they indeed fell from a monkey bridge or otherwise fell into rapids/water by accident then a) more remains would be found and b) be found earlier. Lastly, the video promises to provide an Occam's Razor conclusion of what most likely happened but fails to do that.",

The gang members knew where the women were staying and their whole itinerary because the tour guide and others in the town told them. I also believe many in the town kept quiet about the case out of fear of retribution from the members of the gang. The women were most likely intercepted on the trail by the gang members and was beaten, raped, then dismembered later on. Then a plan was put together by the gang to make it seem like a mysterious death. Eventually, when the case got international attention, and the truth started coming out, the gang members started killing each other off out of fear of being ratted out. This explains many of the gang members dying mysteriously months/years after. This was probably not the first time this gang murdered foreigners leading up to this case. People, stay out of Panama. And RIP to these two women.",

All I can say is about this case is and I’m not trying to be heartless but if you’re not Hispanic with olive skin and know how to speak Spanish and you go to these places be it Panama, Equador or anywhere where the locals have either olive skin or darker you’re going to more or less get yourself in some kind of danger. The thing is that these places including Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico is part of the United States the locals and indigenous people are mostly from a Native American tribe. Puerto Ricans come from the Taino Indians, Panama and Equador either Aztec. I feel these places if you’re white and you’re going into the deep jungles where these indigenous people still live they’re going to see whites as a threat. My sister went to Panama with friends and stayed amongst the locals as long as you look like them and sound like them they will welcome you. Please if you’re not a Hispanic with olive skin and look like indigenous people please stay in the resort areas and do not go into secluded areas especially hiking on some far off trail. Once when I went to Puerto Rico and I went to El Junque it’s a rainforest I heard the people there talking about if they find any “ americanos” that they were going to rob them. These were people who probably never left the island. Please either go with a guide to hike but then again one really can’t trust the guide either because they’re indigenous too🤦🏻‍♀️. Just stay in the resort area and with many many other people.",

    "text": "I'm certain it was not foul play and I can give natural explanations for pretty much all the unusual events.\n     I believe they made it to the second monkey bridge and Kris fell off it and was severely injured. This was when the first emergency call attempt was made.\n     For five days, almost perfectly routine, they made attempts to contact emergency services. They gave up trying on the 6th of April to make any more attempts.\n      They never left the river where Kris was injured. Probably a broken leg or fractured foot. \n     The night photos on the 8th make perfect sense. They were trying to illuminate the tree canopy to create a larger signal beacon. It failed because no hikers or native villagers would have been out in the rain to see it.\n     I believe they survived up to the 11th. But I think Kris might not of woke up on the morning of the 11th and Lisanne tried in a very weakened state to try emergency call.\n    If you get into their minds. \n\nFor 5 days you try emergency calls, yelling for help. \n     \"Where are the searchers? Is no one coming? No one cares that we have been gone for five days?\"\n    \n Now you tack on five more days. By the 11th of April they gave up. No one cares we have been missing for 10 days. Hopelessness sets in, you are starving, exhausted, wet and possibly in physical pain.\n      Why was the night photo of Kris's hair \"clean\" and \"dry\".\nKris probably used one of the backpacks as a pillow. The tangled hair kind of proves sleeping on a backpack.\n     $83 found in one backpack. Seems strange that a 3rd party wouldn't just take the money.\n     It seems silly that some suggest the camera photos were edited by 3rd party but I see zero evidence of that theory.\n     The \"missing\" 509 photo. Nope not missing at all. The SD card had been removed. The photo button pressed with no card slotted and it counted 509 into memory. No flash is triggered when you do this. So the memory SD card was reinserted and photo 510 was recorded and allowed the flash to trigger. \n    Why was the SD card first removed? They wanted to use the flash as a beacon but didn't want to save the photos. But they discovered the flash won't trigger if the SD card is not inserted.\n     They both died of natural causes very close to the river. Scavenger animals fed on their bodies. The river washed down their remains taking the backpacks with it.\n     Why was Kris's jean shorts removed?\nThey had gotten soaked on the night April 7th to early morning of the 8th. The next dry day probably the 10th Lisanne took them to dry them in the sun. They were never put back on because Kris had passed a way.",

IF they had become lost, they would have tried to contact for help and/or the search would have found their trail or clues during the search. IF an accident had happened, their bodies or one of them would have been found whole. A photo is deleted exactly after they became missing, and all photos after that are weird snapshots that make little sense. Someone seems to have tried to access the phone by attempting to guess the password, which the girls themselves wouldn't have done unless in a fugue state but again, if they were indeed in some dazed condition, they would have attempted to get help or get out of the trail, which apparently never happened. Getting lost from the trail also seems very unlikely for that particular area. Additionally, IF foul play was the case, the perpetrator(s) would most likely choose the river as preferred setup to make it look like an accident, and that would seem to be the case. Then the weird involvement of that gang and the suspicious deaths surrounding it only strengthens the foul play scenario. THen also to consider, countries like Panama are well-known for kidnappings and murders of tourists, usually women and children. But as per usual, law enforcement in such countries is below par, dare I call it amateuristic and in some cases even involved. Not claiming such is the case here but indeed, the case leaves a lot to be desired. My heart goes out every day to ALL men, women and children that meet their end on this sickened Earth. And many thousands upon thousands do perish each and every day which I try to be fully aware of every second of every day. <3",

In addition to adding an  implausible   hypothesis of an alleged kidnapping by a local gang in the middle of the forest and still returning with the two on the same frequented trail, taking them to a nightclub!  What is missing to at least begin to evaluate something is a topographical survey showing the exact location of the photos where the two appear last. The location of all houses in the vicinity of the point in this last photo and who are its inhabitants. The exact location of the two rope bridges. The volume of water in the river in those days. The exact location where the backpack and bones were found. It is known that animals can scatter bones. I don't know if an examination was made of the heel bone that was inside the boot to find out how it was separated from the rest of the leg. And there are still many other details and testimonials missing that I don't have space to expose here.",

One famous one, on the AT. Geraldine Largay, was walking the trail. She had to go to the restroom, and like most hikers, she went into the woods to do so. Only she went to far, got lost, and was found 2 years later. There are many stories out there, about people leaving the trail, who survived, and those who didn’t. It happens People always say their loved ones would not go off trail, and they do, for whatever reason. Not saying this is what happened, but it happens all of the time. Even I have changed my mind and went off trail. People who say their loved one would never go off trail, are fooling themselves. Hikers will and do. Maybe it is their families way to make sense of it all, I get it. You can easily miss someone, while searching. I don’t think they fell off of anything, but I need to see the area. My first thought, was they were murdered.",

    "text": "11:28 That's not reddish-blonde hair. That's thin blonde hair over pinkish skin. If you look at the pictures of the girls, the one with blonde hair has thin hair, you can see it from her part-- thicker hair has more volume, and you don't usually see that much of the scalp unless it's done super neatly.\n\nThere's bloom in the shot-- look at the way the color of her hair bleeds into the background. That piece of reddened hair is just a result of camera artfacting, reflecting her skin into the hair.\n\nWhich leads me to believe this is a photo of the back of her head. It's super tangled, probably because she hadn't tied it back (they weren't expecting to be out there long.)\n\nBut the thing that raises red flags for me is that stray brown hair in the image. That's not a camera quirk, that's definitely hair. But why would her hair be angled like that? Reaching towards her friend? I have long brown hair, this really only happens if you're taking an image of something below you and your hair ends up dangling in the shot.\n\nThen there's the way her hair is resting. You can see her forelock angled out, really all of her hair fanning out, but as you can see from the rest of the images, her hair isn't styled, it's flat. The only way I could see it appearing this way, if it really is the back of her head, is if she were laying down with her face in the dirt, and her friend (or someone else with longer brow hair,) is taking the picture while standing over her.",

    "text": "Personally, I think it’s pretty clear they got killed. These girl kept a diary, took many photos and videos and you’re telling me they didn’t take a single photo or recorded a video after they got lost? Like others suggested, I find it really strange that they didn’t record a short video (or wrote at least in the iPhone’s notebook) explaining what happened to them. Especially when they were close to the end and lost all hope, you’d expect them to leave some sort of explanation for their family so they can find peace. I think this is what any of us would do in a similar situation. Also, how the backpack randomly turned up in good condition after 2 months? I also find it very strange that more remains were not found. Even if wild animals fed on them, they don’t eat the bones so you would expect more of them to show up. Where is the skull, rib cage or the femur? And on top of that you’re telling me that the 2 gang members died shortly after they disappeared and others have gone missing too? The Panamanian police is either extremely bad at their job or they learnt exactly what happened but decided to cover it up. If they ruled it as a murder, it would have driven away all the tourist from Panama for the foreseeable future which would have really hurt the country. So they were probably “instructed” to rule it as an accident. It’s really sad because these two poor girls will never get justice for what happened to them and who knows how many other victims might have been before and after them.😞",

    "text": "what i think happened to the girls:\n\nYou know when they booked a tour to Boquete bc it’s their first time to Panama? right, but they decided to go alone, why? Maybe it’s bc the 2 ppl that had brunch with them maybe had a conversation about lisanne and kris booking a tour then MAYBE the 2 people told them that it was safe to go without a tour to lead them and confirm their safety. But they decided to go hiking alone, Now in one of the pictures showed a lake / river and maybe when they got lost, kris took a bath, but lisanne didn’t, why? Because only kris’ shorts were found, now the river is close to the forest, lisanne maybe refused but kris didn’t, maybe it was to take photos and send it to her bf nor post it on social media? we don’t know, then when they got to the forest, only kris’ photos were found, that’s why she wanted to go there. To take photos then instead of going back they continued to walk further and further deep into the forest, and got lost even more so eventually it would be night right? in a few days lisannes phone died, and there was no use of calling 911 bc there wasn’t any signal in the forest, so they made an S.O.S sign out of the map they ripped (shows in one of the photos) now, you see the weird photos “they” took at night? yeah, weird photos, there was one photo of a tree from below, yk? like someone laying below a tree and taking a picture? And they proceed to take really creepy and weird photos, there was a photo of kris’ hair from behind right? That could maybe have been taken by lisanne, bc there was IMG #509 that was deleted, so if your thinking like : “There could’ve been a kidnapper from behind” I don’t believe it. so when they were just giving up, they had no food and they were starving. There could’ve been a kidnapper and attacked kris, so yk the phone replays? there was “someone” or “something” trying to open kris’ phone but didn’t know the PIN so the phone was officially shutted down and i think lisanne was trying to open kris’ phone, and tried to run away but the kidnapper cut lisannes foot, yk that picture of her foot rotting? that’s a clean slice so it couldn’t be an animal or any type of accident, it could have been a human being right? and lisanne has a camera, kris also has a camera. but lisannes camera was in her pocket and accidentally took a pic of the kidnapper so that’s why IMG #509 is deleted, the kidnapper deleted the photo so the police wouldn’t find out. and there’s one little teori i believe, in Panama there are a lot of ethnic groups and in some, they use humans to be their “sacrifice” or smth, but they only use perfect humans. Kris was attacked so she obviously had wounds right? and lisannes foot was cut off, inside lisannes shoe is her rotten foot that even has bones. so maybe the people fed their bodies to hyenas or any wild animals, that’s why bones were found in the location where kris’ shorts were found, so yeah.",

U have to dress accordingly the weather can change  abruptly. .Its also very easy to lose track of time when hiking and so food and water are essential . This hike was apparently an easy hike but thats coming from the locals who would  be more familiar with the terrain.  There are many hazards on a hike some unexpected . I do love my outdoors fishing and camping but its important to familiarise yourself with your surroundings, and always remember nature can be unforgiving i dont believe anything untoward  or  sinister happened to these girls it was most probably a series of unfortunate events which culminated in their tragic deaths RIP.",

I am also pretty sure Feliciano was the one who contacted the girls’ families, not host family. I do suppose it’s possible he had something to do with the disappearance, but he reported them missing the very next day after their hikes. Why not just play stupid and say they never showed up? That is 100x more suspicious than contacting the victims’ families AND a national missing person’s organization",

The other kept surviving by staying near the river drinking the water trying to find a route and enter the phone but didnt know the pasword and later died to. The clothes that were folded and not dirty or look aged is a mystery... Which make me think of theory 2\nThey got followed or waited up on the mountain by some gang members or saw something where not supposed to? Got taken and smacked in the head and while taken they made pictures ? But then why the pictures are without anybody on them... Maybe they were lost first, and got hurt, while looking for a way back home found some drug lab or bad gang people and got taken. Later some of their bones and clothes were brought up the mountain again and placed on location with that picture removed.",

Tourism , reputation,  lets be honest it would have been all over every western TV for weeks . \n\nI reckon the decision was made to cover it up and make if look like a accident .\n\nMy theory comes from the fact , two intelligent,  woman got lost , then more lost on a tourist path . its a path walked by locals and travellers everyday , its not mount everest .\n\nall the bodies that popped up aftwards , either its murder capital of the world or its suspicious that so many , young ppl died that had contact with the  girls. Then there is  the german assistant of the tour guide, she  made a fast exit bk to Germany, prob suspected somthing and wanted out before it chewed her up aswell",

Panama is a very poor country that relies on a small number of tourists each year as its only source of revenue...What little police 🚔 they have are easily corrupted by bribes or Gang intimidation...With gangs comes drugs and gangs are large groups of aggressive males that are in their teens to early 20's in a place where beautiful college aged females are non-existant except for the naive tourists in party mode...They probably hang around bars looking for highly intoxicated girls to prey on or drug then take advantage of sexually, things can go sideways very easily and unfortunately for the gangs silencing and making the victims go away is their best option to avoid bringing any attention to themselves...They also know that the locals and the media are going to keep it on the hush in order to protect the tourism!!  Mexico for example the biggest, nicest, most popular and expensive resorts are right in the heart of Cartel territory...you'll never know it bcuz the cartels fiercely protect and provide security to the resorts bcuz of the billions in revenue tourism brings , don't forget all the illicit drug sales to tourists",

The second is that they didn't document the hike after the 911 calls (except from the night ones on the 8th). If they were hurt or lost why wouldn't they take photos of what they went through? Most people try to document their last days if they are hurt or lost in the wilderness. Why wouldn't the girls do this?",

Her foot broke right where it was supposedly \"chopped off\", her body decomposed and we find that it wasn't just a normal fall she had. She had instead broken her ankle, there are reports the one lady did have a fall. Alone, in a hot and humid place with no food or water. And it gets pitch black dark in Panama around 6:30 to 7:00. If you don't have experience in the forest, you shouldn't be going out there. Some people get lost just going in 50 meters. As soon as I heard they went without a guide, I knew they were already dead. These ladies were starving and dehydrated, in an unforgiving climate that can change as easy as snapping your fingers. They came from Europe, to a climate so much more extreme they are used to. Being lost in the wilderness you feel so helpless and you hallucinate so much quicker the weaker your body is. Everything was stacked against them, there is no foul involved at all. Everyone tripping about one photo, it was obvious they had to delete things to make more room. You can delete a photo without a laptop, as long as that camera was never connected to the internet. They were two humans in an environment they are not used to. They straight up were lost, delirious, dehydrated, and starving. I doubt they could remember their pincodes after a while, again y'all don't know how it feels to be lost in the wilderness.",

    "text": "Why just ‘accident’ and ‘foul play’ theories - what about simply ‘lost’? I think that one of them may have suffered an accident and injury, which would explain the first emergency call not long after the last ‘normal’ photo, but it’s less likely that both of them would have suffered the same accident. \n\nWhile some things don’t add up and a case can be made for the foul play theory, I think on balance the most logical explanation is that they were ill-prepared, warned not to go without a guide but continued on a trail they were unfamiliar with in conditions and an environment they weren’t used to, got lost (and possibly injured) and sadly died from exposure.\n\nI know true crime fans are predisposed to concluding that every unexplained disappearance or death must involve foul play, but some of the theories in the comments here about criminal conspiracies etc. are outlandish in my opinion. Sadly there is a lot of misinformation out there about this case, the police investigation has also been criticised and there is a language barrier which can result in mistranslation etc. which can all influence what one thinks about the case. \n\nWhat’s not up for debate is that this is a really sad tragedy and I think a learning point for anyone that if you are going into any potentially hazardous environment, to make sure you’ve got some knowledge and equipment/supplies to help keep you safe in the event anything untoward happens, and to know your limits.",

    "text": "Considering only SOME parts of their bodies were recovered, it’s not like a killer would just dismember someone in the jungle like that. It’s unlikely, however it is likely an animal like a big cat would tear flesh apart and scatter it around and eat some of it hence the rest of the bodies not been found. I still think this was a vicious animal attack. Maybe one of the girls was killed or injured heavily by a predatory animal and the other one ran away but got injured/attacked again and passed away as a result. It’s possible she fell down a small cliff while trying to get away and broke some bones, immobilising her. Cmon guys, the jungles full of predators 😭 foul play is definitely a possibility but imo it’s not as likely as what I just mentioned.\n\nEdit: the victims personal belongings could have been moved miles away from where the actual scene was. There are monkeys in that jungle and everyone knows those little critters like to take foreign objects and look at/move them around. If this was foul play, I’d assume the culprits would at least try to break the camera rather than leave it knowing that masses of people would go looking for two foreign and wealthier missing women from a European country.",

I doubt this case will ever be solved, its almost a decade now, i truly hope that the \nfamilies have been able to have a bit of peace.  Being a parent and a grandparent i do not believe i would ever be \nable to be a peace with this tragedy.  I wish the girls just did not venture out on their own without a guide, its way to\ndangerous, they do not know the area and vastness of it. Not to mention they ventured out too late in the afternoon, \nit gets dark early.",

I was a soldier with the 235th Signal detachment of the 101st airborne and I was in Honduras support of training the Contras to defeat the Sandinistas of Nicaragua,  supporting the El Salvador army to defeat the communist  guerrilla group FARC there. I also spent time in Panama because back then as it is now a major transportation hub for drugs,  human trafficking,  guns, you name it.  I didn't smoke but I would buy Marlboro cigarettes by the carton. Anywhere I went, I would find a local policeman give him a pack and ask him where it was safe to go have fun when off duty. You go here and nowhere else or and the index finger across the neck, never venture into the mountains alone, which we didn't unless on duty and armed. Women are treated like crap in Central America,  ever here of Machismo? The drug cartels  and gangs run these countries, don't go there unless with an organized group or business. What happened was these fair haired, skinned, naive  European girls turned back advances of some gang members and foolishly advertised their plans and the rest was bound to happen. If you want to explore on your own, the best place to go is Costa Rica, but even there, it's not as safe as it was when I was stationed in Central America. I could tell you stories you wouldn't believe my two years there on how violent it is in some of those places.",

The men wanted sexual intercourse, but the girsl thought they were just being nice...anyway, isn' t it interesting for anyone that, according to some sources, these two men died within a year compared to the disappearance of the girls? They say one of them died in a car accident the other one might have suffocated because he was found near a lake.....Ok. Isn' t it strange? What conclusion can you draw?These two men must have been the killers. Don' t mess with the Dutch!!! ( because they take revenge)",

The fear they instill in their victims isn't just everyday fear. Those demons back it up with examples of exactly what they should fear, if they go against them, and those examples would happen right before their eyes.\nSounds crazy yeah? It's really not so crazy. And one needs to remember; gangs operate with impunity in that part of the world. The authorities will not be helpful, either from lack of funds to dedicate to the cause, (yeah right.), of finding out what happened, or the authorities are sitting right in the pockets of the gangs. They do that often. Corruption is not rare in those countries. Heck, governmental corruption isn't rare in ANY country these days. \nDo not think me cruel and heartless after my next statement but, IF those girls were still alive, it would be way better if they weren't.",

Such destinations can be very dangerous even for seasoned travellers, let alone two young girls on their first travel adventure and for whom everything would have been new and exciting and exhilarating, Sadly there are many equally beautiful countries in the world they could have visited that are very much safer.",

I think people are coming up with scary scenarios in their head and cherry-picking a few select elements of the story that support their theory.  The abduction and murder of western tourists happens of course but I don’t believe this is one of those situations.  All of the “strange” aspects of the case that people reference can be explained without reaching.  As for that area being dangerous and many women being killed there , that is a phenomenon that happens all over South America where femicide is common and the targets are mostly people from there .",

I got sucked into this case a few years back & I can’t remember the source of the original videos I watched talking about these girls. But I remember their was some evidence that these 2 girls thought they were being chased by ‘monkeys’ , which is a very interesting fact considering their are a lot of cannibal tribes that will send each other slight messages using the sound of animals including monkeys. The bones found looked as if they were bleached, cannibals cooking the remains would have made the bones look as such, not to mention the skin that was found rolled into a ball. This would also explain why the tribe would not be interested in their backpack & its belongings.",

Any time I travel to another place whether a different county or town I read, research and find as much information as I can about the place so I know exactly where I'm visiting, what places to explore and what places to avoid. Most specially, if a local says don't go someplace you BETTER LISTEN as they know why they are giving you a warning. May they RIP",

All parties trekking int such environments need in addition to food, water , tentage, sleeping bags, rope, machete, fire and cooking stove, torch, map and compass and GPS, a short barrelled high velocity assault weapon and a pistol. You need to regard the trek as a military patrol if you wish to live. The route and timings should be logged with a base which should follow the progress of the women who should stick to the route. There needs to be an emergency plan. Best to avoid contact with other travellers in case of ambush. Overnight stays in the jungle are extremely hazardous. This environment is not suitable for young trekkers, and especially for young women. I would not allow any daughter of mine to attempt such a hazardous journey.",

Margarita's son very likely did die as part of the cover up.\n\nBut let's not forget that they could have easily died from quite a few other reasons. Monkeys can attack humans and in a group, they can be extremely dangerous. There are plenty of other wild animals that could do it too. A fall could have done this just as easily. That trail was dangerous.\n\nI spent time down in Central America myself. Easy to make a wrong move and end up becoming a statistic and a newspaper heading.\n\nAnd these two girls went off to do exactly that as two girls apparently not as immune as they thought they were to the cold hard reality of Central America.\n\nDumb.",

Any one of us, man or woman, could have met a similar fate. It all depends on the specific circumstances we encounter. If foul play was present (which common sense says it is lol), only not being there at all could have saved these poor women. And saying \"they should not have been there\" is a cop out. The had just as much right to be on that trail as any other person. If someone or a group of people committed a horrible act against these women, the young ladies are not to blame; the perpetrators are at fault. Unfortunately, it is likely that we will never know what actually happened that day. Just be careful, stay vigilant, and use tales like these to assist you in avoiding a similar end.",

Starvation, dehydration, sickness (there are dozens of pathogens in Central America that reside in fresh water that can kill you), attacks by an animal, flash floods, falling off a cliff, exposure, etc. Most likely, one of was injured and the other stayed with them until some event took both their lives, hence why their bodies were found relatively close together. \n\nJust because we don’t know the exact method in which they died doesn’t mean we should just throw all logic to the wind and start creating unlikely conspiracy theories, such as gang activity, government coverups, and murder.",

Maybe actually look into why and do something to prevent it from happening, prevent these predators from becoming predators so that everyone can travel wherever they want at any time of day.

    "text": "By far the most likely theory is that they got lost on the first day as they were trying to head back down the trail. They tried to call emergency services several times but were unable to get through. They continued deeper into the rain forest and at some point came to the river. They decided to follow the river thinking it would lead them to civilization. Instead, it lead them further and further away. They survived for days based on phone and camera data but at some point perished due to lack of food, exhaustion and possibly dysentery from drinking the river water. One of them probably died first and the other stayed in that area and was probably too weak to continue. I point you to the story of Amanda Eller who was lost in Hawaii for 17 days in an area significantly smaller than this. No way some gang or rapist is going to follow someone 10 miles into the rainforest to kill them. Also, a criminal wouldn't let them use their phone and camera repeatedly. The mystery photos are the result of trying to use the flash to see at night or to scare away an animal in the bushes. Lastly, the dog that was with them was very familiar with the area. When if got dark the first night, the dog peaced out and found his way home. I work in wilderness search and rescue and it is not uncommon for people to get off a trail and never find their way back, wandering for days until finally succumbing. I point you to the story of Geraldine Largay who's body was found less than two miles from the trail after getting lost.",

    "text": "Just speculation: Three men knew the girls were going to hike the trail that day: the taxi driver and the two men (apparently already in the taxi when the girls got into it if I remember correctly). Four men knew if one includes the guide who went into their room and went through their things. Did he know they weren't coming back?\nLocals have said they heard girls screaming, a huge crash, and then three men exiting (running out of) the trail.\nThe crash was more than likely Kris and Lisanne being pushed over into the ravine (the screams were an indicator that they were either being chased or attacked?) The predators had to kill them because the girls knew them? \nThe photographs are seemingly taken at the bottom of the ravine *looking upwards to where the body/bodies had fallen from). It is possible that the person who found the backpack and the body/bodies (some parts at least, considering Kris' hair) was taking photos (checking to see if it worked perhaps?) and was taking photos upwards to where the body had fallen from. Kris' hair was quite clean which is odd; was she in water or in some protected area? It's chilling to think that perhaps the attackers/killers eventually made their way down to the bodies...Perhaps what was left of the bodies was found soon after the plunge to their deaths but left there, unreported, and only the backpack was taken.\nThe deleted photo? Perhaps the backpack was handed to someone else (a guide, or someone else in authority) and that person encouraged them to hand it over to authorities, or perhaps the people who found the body took the backpack home with them and at some point got scared (superstitions could also add to the fear) and then handed it in at a later date. Perhaps they were too afraid to admit to finding Kris (and perhaps Lisanne) because they had taken the backpack? Kris had beautiful hair - hair that would be noticeable anywhere! Two lovely girls who were probably taught that a stranger is just a friend you do not know!",

If it was just a consequence of an error by the camera, well that's definitely the ugliest joke by fate ever.\ni also don’t believe it was necessary for them to switch the SD-cards. it just doesn’t make any sense, all these theories about that they probably didn’t want to save the picture and etc. sound like pure bullshit. Everything was ok till photo 509. i don’t believe they’ve just stopped making photos after they crossed the stream at pic 508. \n\n2) photos taken in the night after a few DAYS in the jungle. these pics are weird af and i can never believe they could not record themselves if they were alive at that time. just a few pics with their faces, legs, bodies would be enough to make it clear. \n\ni used to believe that after 4 pm on April 1st the girls headed off the trail and got in trouble but it wasn't a catastrophe, and they were alive until April 4th. \nALSO i believe the camera was stolen/lost and those night pics were not made by them.\nthen after April 4th something really bad happened and MAYBE they've met with foul play.\nMaybe they were not murdered but somebody was involved. Maybe it’s just a huge cover up case for someone not to be mentioned, ever.",

    "text": "Hello. I have been following this case for a long time. Here's just some information:\n\nThe night time pictures are all of the same patch of sky. It's actually possible to overlap them, to show that someone was on the ground, pointing the camera up, and took a bunch of pictures of the exact same area. I personally believe the girl holding the camera fell off a cliff, down an escarpment, into a wadi, or whatever other earth term there is for saying \"fell down, got hurt, steep drop\" they weren't using the flash to find their way, it was one girl trying to signal where she was to the other girl.\n\nThe missing picture? I think that happened during the fall. It's possible that the jolting of the camera caused it to go off, but it's battery could have gotten rattled at the same time, creating and error at the same time as the picture was taken. This would cause it to be 'deleted' and still counting as being there, at the same time.\n\nI think they both were very smart. They must have used a watch to help them figure out when to turn on their phones. I'm guessing one of them had a digital watch set to go off at like, 10am every day. They didn't waste the batteries, they kept to a schedule. They were very intelligent, most people would have panicked and ran the batteries dry in a day or two.\n\nI think the bras in their bag were actually their bathing suit tops. I think they used the straps from them to help make some sort of splint for the injured girl. The straps were never found.\n\nI think the initial injury wasn't fatal, but it did heavily hamper their ability to travel. \n\nI think they both did eventually die near the river, cause their body parts were found downstream.\n\nI think that one girl's body was near fire ants. The phosphorous? That's made by fire ants after they eat stuff.\n\nI don't think that the tour guide is responsible. He was the one who kept pushing the cops to DO anything. The cops were going to ignore the entire case. If he was guilty, he could have literally sat back and done nothing. He is honestly a good guy, from what we've seen. \n\nI do believe this was just two girls, dying in the rainforest. I don't see any sign of foul play at all. One fell off a cliff, got hurt, then at some point, they both died near a river. Possibly fell into it? It's hard to say. The injuries to the feet bones make it sound like at least one had a particularly brutal fall. Whether that was the fall that injured her, or killed her, is hard to say.",
