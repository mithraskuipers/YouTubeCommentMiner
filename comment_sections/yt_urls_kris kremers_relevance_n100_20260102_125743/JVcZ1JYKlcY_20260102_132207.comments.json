Some evidence showed early healing, suggesting she may have survived for a short time after the injury.\n\nPeriostitis (inflammation of tissue around the tibia) attributed to repetitive use before the incident. \n\nA rolled-up “ball” of skin found in August (nearly five months later) still had maggots and showed little decomposition. Investigators speculated it may have been stored in cooler/darker conditions before being deposited—raising suspicions of tampering.",
