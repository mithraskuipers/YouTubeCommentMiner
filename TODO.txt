- Also retrieve replies on comments.
- comment_search.py Can you add the functionality to also extract the comments of a specific user? And also to search in those as well? Can you also add the feature to detect the most active user found in the comments? So you could run it multiple times first to detect the most active user, then extract all his/her comments?
